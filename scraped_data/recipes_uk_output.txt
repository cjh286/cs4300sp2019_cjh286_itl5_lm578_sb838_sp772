As with many classic cocktails, especially those with obvious names, the origins of the Cosmopolitan are disputed. A Cosmopolitan based on gin and raspberry first appears in a rare 1934 cocktail book; Ocean Spray promoted a blend of vodka, cranberry and lime during the 1960s under the name Harpoon. Most experts credit Cheryl Cook with formulating and naming the modern Cosmopolitan in the 1980s. Most also agree that Dale DeGroff transformed Cook's Cosmopolitan into the tart, fruity drink we know today, and that Toby Cecchini had a similar idea. The key to the Cosmo is balance, which will vary according to your choice of base vodka. Smirnoff No. 21 has a crisp flavour profile that brings out the zinging fruit of the cranberry juice. Smirnoff Lime adds a fruit explosion, or use Ketel One for citrus and honeyed flavours, or even C\u00eeroc for a subtler hint of fruit. Good quality cranberry juice is also critical. Flaming an orange twist makes great theatre and adds a hint of caramelised orange oil to both scent and flavour: even if you opt not to flame the zest, be sure the oil sprays over the cocktail.

The trick to building the flavour in a classic Mojito cocktail recipe comes from getting those grains of sugar in amongst the lime peel to extract delicious natural oils and juice.

El Draque was a blend of sugar cane spirit, lime, sugar and mint, laying the foundations of a great drink. But it was only with the addition of rum and soda that the Mojito as we know it today was created. Rapidly established as the cocktail of choice by Americans taking time out from Prohibition, the Mojito became a symbol of good times across the Florida Straits in Cuba. Author Ernest Hemingway frequented La Bodeguita del Medio in the 1950s and enjoyed a Mojito at this now-famous Havana bar. But a spike in interest came in the early 2000s following the release of the Cuba-based film Buena Vista Social Club.

Experts agree that the Margarita appeared in Mexico in the late 1930s, in the aftermath of several similar tequila cocktails that lack the defining salt rim: the Tequila Daisy, the Picador and the Tequila Sidecar. The common story is that Carlos \u2018Danny\u2019 Herrera devised it at the Rancho La Gloria Hotel, near Tijuana, for a dancer named Marjorie King. Following this, American holidaymakers brought their taste for Margaritas home from Mexico; by 1953, the Margarita, over crushed ice, was \u2018Drink of the Month\u2019 in Esquire magazine. Frozen Margaritas grew in popularity until 1971 when a Dallas restaurateur named Mariano Martinez invented the frozen Margarita machine. This stroke of genius made the Margarita America's bestselling cocktail and led, inevitably, to the premixes of the 1980s. Today the Margarita has returned to its roots \u2013 a classically styled, deliciously simple cocktail that showcases the herbaceous flavour of tequilas such as Don Julio Blanco. Many bartenders like to serve the drink with salt on only half the rim.

Or at least, that\u2019s the case if you don\u2019t follow the dictates of the fictional James Bond, who requested his Martini \u201cShaken not stirred\u201d for the first time in Ian Fleming\u2019s Dr. No novel in 1958. So\u2026to shake or to stir? Shaking enters the world of cocktail making when you need to combine two pretty incompatible ingredients \u2013 e.g. a spirit and egg white as with the Sour, or vodka and cream, such as in the case of the White Russian. It\u2019s hard to understand why you\u2019d do this with vermouth and a white spirit. Shaking certainly does give a little aeration, and it doesn\u2019t \u2018bruise\u2019 the white spirit in a Martini as some experts claim \u2013 there\u2019s no evidence to back up this piece of poetic licence. In other words, just create the Martini the way you want, remembering that stirring gently gives just the right dilution, while amalgamating the ingredients. Traditionally made with gin, trends in the 1990s led to vodka taking over as the default Martini base. But the Gin Martini has bounced back to compete with the Vodka Martini, and it has history on its side. That\u2019s because the Martini evolved from a combination of the Manhattan and the Martinez, which was based on Dutch genever (the forerunner of gin) and Old Tom bin (a sweet, early version of gin). Early versions of the Martini were sweet, like the Martinez \u2013 hence the need to emphasise a \u2018Dry\u2019 Martini\u2019 later on. As the recipe became refined, the popularity of the Martini soared. It has by far and away the most TV and film mentions of any cocktail, from William Powell in The Thin Man, to Jason Alexander playing George Costanza in Seinfeld. Dorothy Parker talked about the Martini at the Algonquin Hotel in New York, and Eric Stolz references the classic cocktail in his 2005 film Kicking and Screaming. What about the garnish? Well, again there\u2019s debate \u00acas to whether you use a lemon twist or olive. We\u2019ve gone for an olive because this lets the other ingredients shine through in the cocktail.

From the 1960\u2019s favourite the Black Russian, through to the Irish Coffee of the 1970s and 1980s, by way of the Espresso martinis of the 1990s and 2000s, derives the Smirnoff Espresso martini. The Smirnoff version takes its origins from Bradsell's drink but updates it into a contemporary, creamier, dessert-style drink that showcases the real coffee flavour of Smirnoff Espresso and acknowledges today's fondness for creamier coffees, such as Lattes.

One story credits the Long Island Iced Tea to a bootlegger named Old Man Bishop from Kingsport, Tennessee, during the 1920s, but if he did create a drink of that name, it must have been a very different blend. Another variation attributes the Long Island Iced Tea's creation to drinkers trying out cola with different spirits. Most, however, accept that Robert \u2018Rosebud\u2019 Butt, then bartender at the Oak Beach Inn on Long Island, New York, invented the Long Island Iced Tea around 1972 as part of a cocktail competition designed to use the orange liqueur known as triple sec. By the early 1980s, the Long Island Iced Tea had spread a long way from its homeland. It would go on to spawn a multitude of variations \u2013 notably the New England Iced Tea, with cranberry in place of cola, and the tequila-led Texas Iced Tea. The art of a good Long Island Iced Tea is simple. Opt for premium spirits, like Smirnoff No. 21 and Gordon's London Dry Gin, use plenty of ice and citrus, and never, ever overdo the cola.

Trader Vic, born Victor Bergeron, was a one-legged restaurateur with a genius for marketing and publicity. He rapidly followed in the Beachcomber's footsteps. And, as World War II fuelled the American desire for escapism and made rum the spirit of choice, Tiki began to flourish. Rum cocktails, palm thatched shacks, drinks served in coconut shells, beautiful waitresses in Hawaiian leis, exotic artefacts and live music created an exhilarating whirl of colour in otherwise dark times.

It seemed natural enough to mix Cuban rum with cola, even though cola represented the ruling powers at the time. The lime juice, meanwhile, may well be a later addition. Newspapers from the 1930s describe the drink as simply rum and cola, and it could have been the roving mixologist Charles H. Baker who transformed the Cuba Libre by adding lime around 1939. During World War II, as American distilleries were turned over to war manufacturing, whiskey was in short supply and rum became the spirit of choice. Hence the Cuba Libre's popularity peaked. A song named \u201cRum and Coca-Cola\u201d would be the number one hit single of 1945. Fresh lime juice is absolutely critical to the Cuba Libre. It cuts the sweetness of the cola and brings out the flavours of the base rum, transforming the drink. Charles H.

Blessed with a chiselled jaw and swashbuckling good looks, a passion for rum, and that Pacific art collection, Gantt's natural next step was to open a bar. This he did in 1934, calling the place Don\u2019s Beachcomber Cafe, and naming himself Don the Beachcomber (he would later change his name by deed poll to Donn Beach). The beach-shack theme of the bar, with its Pacific islands details, like carved heads and elaborate mugs, would inspire the more famous Trader Vic, and kickstart the Tiki fashion that swept across America in the wake of World War II.

Yet the little bar was not sufficient to support Sloan's high-spending lifestyle.

Under MacElhone's guidance, Harry's became a legend, attracting clientele from Coco Chanel to Humphrey Bogart, from Rita Hayworth to Ernest Hemingway. When Harry died in 1958, his son Andy MacElhone stepped up to the reins and took over the bar, bringing in friends such as the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and the writer Marguerite Duras. It was Andy who created the Blue Lagoon in 1972, blending vodka, blue cura\u00e7ao and fresh lemon juice to create a classically tangy, brilliant blue drink that has been through several permutations since.

The Negroni cocktail was invented, so the story goes, in the Italian city of Florence in 1919. A local, Count Camillo Negroni, asked his favourite bartender, Fosco Scarselli, for a variation on his favourite cocktail, the Americano. Instead of soda water, Camillo requested gin be added to vermouth and Campari. Fosco complied, adding a slice of orange as garnish too, instead of lemon. It became the Count\u2019s regular order, other customers started asking for one of Count Negroni\u2019s drinks, and the Negroni cocktail was born.

In 1867 the Merchant Shipping Act made it mandatory for British ships to carry rations of limes to combat scurvy. However, it was hard to keep limes fresh over long sea journeys. So Lauchlin Rose, the owner of a shipyard in Leith, Scotland, solved it with a new product, \u2018Rose\u2019s Lime Cordial\u2019. Sailors mixed lime cordial with rum, but the officers in the navy preferred to use gin instead, and the Gimlet was born, named after a small tool known as a gimlet that\u2019s used to tap barrels on spirits carried on British Navy ships. It\u2019s inspired some of the world\u2019s best bartenders and writers.

The Tom Collins was reputedly invented by London bartender John Collins at Limmer\u2019s Hotel on Conduit Street, London. It was adapted, so the story goes, from the renowned Gin Punch cocktails served at the hotel, with genever (Dutch gin) as the base. The cocktail took the name of its creator, but using Old Tom gin (essentially a sweetened London Dry Gin), it became known as a Tom Collins although there is a story about the Tom Collins originating in New York. In 1874 a hoax took place where customers were told about an imaginary person insulting them in a neighbouring bar called Tom Collins, but it may just have been named after the already-created drink. In his 1876 The Bartender\u2019s Guide, Jerry Thomas lists a range of Tom Collins cocktails, while Harry Johnson\u2019s 1882 Bartenders\u2019 Manual suggests both lemon and lime juice for his John Collins and reminds readers \u201cthis drink must be taken as soon as it is mixed or it will lose its flavour\u201d.

The story goes that cacha\u00e7a was mixed with lemon, garlic and honey to deal with an outbreak of Spanish flu. However, it continued to be consumed afterwards when people removed the garlic and honey, and added sugar.

However, the basic Caipirinha recipe is simple: chopped fresh limes, crushed with sugar, ice and cacha\u00e7a. The crushing, or muddling is key, as it allows the aromatic oils to emerge from the skin of the lime, adding scent and taste to the finished drink. But the fine details inspire intense debate.

Some argue that using gomme sugar syrup instead of a sugar cube produces a smoother mouthfeel; others like to serve the drink in a coupe-style cocktail glass, rather than a rocks glass. You can find Peychaud's bitters, a New Orleans classic, in specialist drinks shops, or online \u2013 or substitute with Angostura if need be.

With Prohibition, the Sazerac cocktail went out of fashion around the world, yet remained a quintessential taste of New Orleans.

Nowadays ginger beer and ginger ale are used interchangeably, so either can top up the drink \u2013 the only question is then whether you serve it in a traditional copper cup or highball. It all started for the Moscow Mule with the purchase of the US rights to the Smirnoff brand by local entrepreneur Rudolf Kunett in 1933, bringing vodka to the attention of an audience on the other side of the Atlantic. Executive John Martin then persuaded his employers, Heublein, to buy out Kunett, but sales failed to take off. Fast forward to 1946 and Martin is sitting in the Chatham Bar in New York with the owner of Hollywood venue Cock \u2018n\u2019 Bull Jack Morgan, who was finding it hard to sell his own-made ginger beer. So Martin brings his vodka together with Morgan\u2019s ginger beer, they add some lime, probably from a nearby Cuba Libre cocktail, and serve in copper mug containers that another business contact was trying to sell. And so the Moscow Mule was born from this entrepreneurial mix. Martin then took pictures of the cocktail being held by bartenders in one hand, with a bottle of Smirnoff in the other hand. He headed to the neighbouring bar and showed the bartender what they were missing, and repeated. The Smirnoff Vodka Moscow Mule took off with the brand\u2019s backing. It was largely responsible for the popularity of vodka in the 1950s in the US, and has become a modern classic cocktail ever since. Modern variants on the Moscow Mule recipe include the Bohemian Mule, with absinthe instead of vodka; a Jamaican Mule where you add spiced rum, a Mexican Mule based on tequila instead of vodka and the New Orleans Mule which uses bourbon instead of vodka, plus coffee liqueur and pineapple juice.

The result is a rich, molten drinking experience, the first time that real Belgian chocolate has been fused with spirits to deliver the multi-sensory experience of chocolate in a glass. The Baileys team travelled three continents to personally taste over 200 varieties of the world's finest chocolate, working with more than 800 recipes in an attempt to fuse it perfectly with Baileys Original Irish Cream. In recipe after recipe they sought to work out exactly how the drink would pour, and tested its consistency and texture. Ultimately, they left no stone unturned in the pursuit of a chocolate-lovers dream. Eventually combining luxury Madagascan vanilla and more than 30 grams of real Belgian chocolate, they discovered a fusion of premium ingredients that delivers a feast for the senses, escalated through a journey of smell. In each bottle, Baileys Chocolat Luxe has all the great taste of the highest quality chocolate, and the rich, creamy caramel tones of a traditional Baileys. It both melts in the mouth and gives a cooling sensation on the palate. The result is the ultimate drinking experience, bringing together our two favourite indulgences, Baileys and chocolate. The \u2018Rococo serve' is a delicious way of serving the Baileys Chocolat Luxe, created by Bompas & Parr. Take a stemmed glass, add two or three ice cubes and slowly pour 50ml of the Baileys Chocolat Luxe over the ice. Garnish with a raspberry, on an elegant, slender skewer known as an \u2018attelet'.

This number refers to the fact a punch was initially made from five ingredients: wine or brandy, sugar, lemon, water and tea or spices. The punch was brought to England by sailors working for the British East India Company, the trading venture of merchants under indirect government control, who discovered it in the subcontinent. First recorded in Britain in 1632 using wine or brandy as a base \u2013 the English \u2018Wassail\u2019 style of drink \u2013 rum was adopted in 1655 following trade with the Caribbean, and the modern punch was born. By 1671, punch houses were springing up in London. The classic Barbados or \u2018Bajan\u2019 style of rum punch uses rum, lime, sugar, water, Angostura Bitters and nutmeg, and this is the recipe adopted here, combined with the renowned Planter\u2019s Punch which traditionally adds pineapple juice and grenadine syrup too. The Planter\u2019s Punch is said to originate from the Planter\u2019s Hotel in Charleston in the US, although an 1878 edition of the London magazine \u2018Fun\u2019 lists a recipe which concludes \u201cat least, so they say in Jamaica\u201d, hinting at older origins on the Caribbean island. In this Rum Punch there\u2019s an addition of guava juice to further pay homage to the Caribbean locality.

More in line with the naming is that it was inspired by the Russian Tsar Alexander II, or even New York drama critic Alexander Walcott, who penned often highly critical views during the 1920s and 30s. Needless to say, as with many great cocktails, the bartender who devised the brandy version is unknown. But the rise to fame of the Brandy Alexander was rapid, featuring in novels by Evelyn Waugh; appearing in US TV series Cheers, and lending its name to a song by Canadian singer/songwriter Feist on her Juno award-winning album The Reminder. In the Baileys Alexander the indulgent Irish whisky cream liqueur is substituted for brandy, combining beautifully with cream and cr\u00e8me de cacao to create a luscious, elegant cocktail. The drink is garnished with a sprinkling of grated nutmeg to enhance the flavours of Baileys and cacao and provides a decorative finish.

"Created by sailors in the British Navy in the mid-19th century who wanted to balance out the flavour of bitters \u2013 taken at that time to counteract sea sickness \u2013 it was brought to the mainland by the 1870s. By this time many sailors had started drinking it in their regular bars in London and other coastal towns. And with this military heritage, Pink Gin became the favourite drink of any author wanting an air of mystery attached to his or her fictional spy. In the novel version of The Man with the Golden Gun, James Bond orders a pink gin with \u201cplenty of bitters\u201d in the bar of the Thunderbird Hotel in Jamaica, one operated by his arch-enemy Francisco Scaramanga. John Le Carr\u00e9 makes Pink Gin the favourite drink of Jerry Westerby in his novel Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. The crucial question that any bartender should ask when making a Pink Gin is whether you want it \u2018in\u2019 or \u2018out\u2019. To be \u2018in\u2019 means moving the Angostura bitters around in the glass before adding Gordon\u2019s London Dry Gin. To be \u2018out\u2019 means swirling bitters in the glass and then pouring them away, leaving just a small residue. Experiment with both ways to find how you like it.

It\u2019s ideal any time of the year, with fruit-tinged qualities that are lovely for summer, but also a sweet richness and body for enjoying in winter. In fact the main challenge comes in the shopping: tracking down the cherry brandy, the Benedictine and the grenadine. Crushing or juicing a few pomegranate seeds saves buying grenadine, and it tastes even better. However despite all these credentials, the Singapore Sling cocktail is one classic that is less clear-cut. According to 1940s bar expert David Embury in his Fine Art of Mixing Drinks: \u201cOf all the recipes published I have never seen any two that were alike.\u201d A mix of gin, Benedictine and cherry brandy was developed some time between 1899 and 1915 by bartender Ngiam Tong Boon at the Long Bar in the Raffles Hotel, Singapore. He perhaps used Angostura Bitters too, as was common in the later style of \u2018Sling\u2019 style of drink \u2013 the \u2018Bittered Sling\u2019 that had become popular in Singapore in the late 19th century. The original Sling was a late 18th century drink of spirit mixed with sugar and water. The hotel nowadays prints the original recipe as containing lime juice, pineapple juice and Cointreau, but these have a tinge of Tiki about them, and may well be 1970s additions from when Raffles was relaunched as a tourist destination. There\u2019s also celebrated bartender Charles Baker\u2019s method, which he claims comes from Raffles. In his 1939 Gentleman\u2019s Companion, Baker calls for no citrus, but gin and soda to cut through the cherry brandy and Benedictine liqueur instead. The recipe used here is based on Harry Craddock\u2019s 1930\u2019s The Savoy Cocktail Book, a combination of his Singapore Sling and \u2018Straits Sling\u2019 that is likely to be closest to how the original version shaped up, taken from contemporary accounts of the cocktail.", "rating": "2.5", "num_ratings": "202", "img":

Bar owners in New Orleans were required to take up to 50 cases of rum in order to secure a case of whisky or scotch. So New Orleans businessman Pat O'Brien came up with a plan. He mixed together rum, fruit juice and fruit syrup or grenadine, which he served up in a tall, jaunty glass, shaped like a hurricane lamp. This became known as the Hurricane glass, and the Hurricane cocktail had arrived. At first the Hurricane was sold to sailors only, but it soon became a big hit. O'Brien ran his bar as a speakeasy during Prohibition, but continued to operate after its ending in 1933. At the World's Fair in New York in 1939 a \u2018Hurricane bar' was set up to serve his cocktail, and in 1998, Jerry Berry's Beachbum Berry's Grog Log published what was purported to be the exact mix of ingredients served at O'Brien's during the 1960s. The bar is still standing, as Pat O'Brien's, at the intersection of Royal and St Peter streets in New Orleans, and the Hurricane cocktail has been a mainstay in the French Quarter of New Orleans ever since. The Hurricane is not to be confused with another cocktail of the same name that's mixed in the Bahamas, however, which comprises Captain Morgan Original Rum, coffee liqueur, Irish cream liqueur and Grand Marnier. There's also a variation on the Hurricane that you can make with Captain Morgan Original Rum, vanilla liqueur, orange juice, cranberry and a splash of lime. An ideal party drink, with its appealing colour and enjoyable, fruity taste plus a backbone of delicious Captain Morgan Original Rum, the Hurricane is delicious garnished with fruit and served with

name rolls off the tongue as much as the flavour flows over it.

This sinks to the bottom of the glass, creating a sunrise effect in grades of orange. There\u2019s plenty of sun too in its 1970s West Coast origins. The cocktail was created by bartender Gene Sulit at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in the 1930s, using tequila, cr\u00e8me de cassis, lime juice and soda water. However, young bartenders Bobby Lazoff and Billy Rice were working at the Trident bar in Sausalito in California in the early 1970s when they decided to make a version of their own. They kept the tequila \u2013 the Trident was one of the largest sellers of tequila-based drinks in the US \u2013 but replaced the sweet fruit of cassis, sourness of lime and length of soda with an item that covered all these bases. The ingredient was increasingly available from local orchards, and had grown in popularity through the 1960s: orange juice. The popularity of this new Tequila Sunrise was helped too by the decision of promoter Bill Graham to throw a private party in 1972 at the Trident for The Rolling Stones, who had just arrived for a major tour. Jose Cuervo put the recipe on the back of their bottles of tequila in 1973 and in the same year the Eagles recorded a song called \u2018Tequila Sunrise\u2019 for their Desperado album, sealing its popularity. Variations of Tequila Sunrise include a Tequila Sunset using dark rum instead of grenadine, a Florida Sunrise with both pineapple and orange juice, a Caribbean Sunrise with rum instead of tequila, a Vodka Sunrise using vodka instead of tequila and the non-alcoholic Red Sea Sunrise with lemonade in place of tequila.", "rating": "2.5", "num_ratings": "263", "img": "https://uk.thebar.com/assets/en-gb/Images/AU/tequila-sunrise$$069A0000000fAkPIAU.jpg?maxheight=360&maxwidth=540&quality=85", "difficulty": "Easy", "short_desc": "Clean, pure blanco tequila with sweet grenadine and delicious, subtly sour orange juice makes one of the greatest of modern classic cocktails, a drink that has a surprising place in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll history."}, {"recipe": [{"step": "Fill a shaker with ice.", "number": 0}, {"step": "Add Don Julio Blanco Tequila, apple cider, lemon juice and agave nectar to the shaker.", "number": 1}, {"step": "Shake until cold.", "number": 2}, {"step": "Strain into a tall glass filled with ice.", "number": 3}], "ingredients": [{"ingredient": "Don Julio\u00ae Blanco Tequila", "amount": "50ml."}, {"ingredient": "Apple Cider", "amount": "50ml."}, {"ingredient": "Lemon Juice", "amount": "7ml."}, {"ingredient": "Agave Nectar", "amount": "7ml."}], "name": "Harvest Spice", "long_desc": "A winning combination of Don Julio Blanco Tequila and apple cider, with a spritz of lemon juice and sweet agave nectar, this cocktail is like a long twist on a classic Margarita.", "rating": "1.5", "num_ratings": "211", "img": "https://uk.thebar.com/assets/en-gb/Images/AM/tequila-don-julio-anejo-spicy-margarita$$069A0000000eCP9IAM.jpg?maxheight=360&maxwidth=540&quality=85", "difficulty": "Easy", "short_desc": "A winning combination of Don Julio Blanco Tequila and apple cider, with a spritz of lemon juice and sweet agave nectar, this cocktail is like a long twist on a classic Margarita."}, {"recipe": [{"step": "Fill a shaker with ice.", "number": 0}, {"step": "Add Don Julio Blanco Tequila, tabasco, horseradish, worcestershire sauce, celery salt and tomato juice to the shaker.", "number": 1}, {"step": "Shake until cold.", "number": 2}, {"step": "Strain into a glass filled with ice.", "number": 3}, {"step": "Garnish with a lemon slice.", "number": 4}], "ingredients": [{"ingredient": "Don Julio\u00ae Blanco Tequila", "amount": "50ml."}, {"ingredient": "Horseradish", "amount": "1tsp"}, {"ingredient": "Tabasco Sauce", "amount": "3dash(es)"}, {"ingredient": "Worcestershire Sauce", "amount": "3dash(es)"}, {"ingredient": "Celery Salt", "amount": "3dash(es)"}, {"ingredient": "Tomato Juice", "amount": "125ml."}, {"ingredient": "Lemon", "amount": "1slice(s)"}], "name": "Bloody Maria", "long_desc": "Substituting Don Julio Tequila for Smirnoff Vodka in this classic cocktail results in a dry herbal edge to the tomatoey combination that complements the spicy punch.", "rating": "2.5", "num_ratings": "139", "img": "https://uk.thebar.com/assets/en-gb/Images/AK/069a0000000eckqiam$$069A0000001R5BiIAK.jpg?maxheight=360&maxwidth=540&quality=85", "difficulty": "Easy", "short_desc": "Substituting Don Julio Tequila for Smirnoff Vodka in this classic cocktail results in a dry herbal edge to the tomatoey combination that complements the spicy punch."}, {"recipe": [{"step": "Fill a glass with ice.", "number": 0}, {"step": "Pour Don Julio Blanco Tequila, grapefruit juice, lime juice and simple syrup into the glass.", "number": 1}, {"step": "Top with soda water.", "number": 2}, {"step": "Garnish with a wedge of lime.", "number": 3}], "ingredients": [{"ingredient": "Don Julio\u00ae Blanco Tequila", "amount": "50ml."}, {"ingredient": "Grapefruit Juice", "amount": "25ml."}, {"ingredient": "Fresh Lime Juice", "amount": "25ml."}, {"ingredient": "Sugar Syrup", "amount": "17.5ml."}, {"ingredient": "Soda Water", "amount": "25ml."}, {"ingredient": "Lime", "amount": "1wedge(s)"}], "name": "Paloma", "long_desc": "A legend in the town of Tequila in Mexico, where he owns La Capilla (the chapel), a bar just off the main square, Corona has invented a drink that is essentially a long, fruity Margarita.

Not surprisingly it was originally known as the \u2018Adam\u2019s Apple Martini\u2019 before its abbreviated moniker stuck. In the 2010 film The Social Network, the Appletini is shared by Facebook co-founders Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin and Napster co-founder Sean Parker. After he saw the film\u2019s premiere, Zuckerberg made the Appletini the official Facebook cocktail. The Appletini also features in 2006 Jennifer Aniston film The Break Up, and in the recent CBS series Two and a Half Men (2003\u20132015) is the favourite drink of one of the main characters, Alan Harper.

However, the use of chocolate in cocktails is a relatively new phenomenon. It took off in the 1990s when, as with so many other flavours, chocolate was added to the Martini to create a new variant. Bartender Gillian Stanfield invented the Chocolate Biscuit cocktail at the now closed Atlantic Bar & Grill in London in 1999, while Wayne Collins \u2013 formerly of Soho\u2019s Six Degrees bar and BBC TV\u2019s Something for the Weekend fame \u2013 created the Chocolate Sidecar in 2005. And this brings us to the use of orange liqueur in cocktails. Orange liqueur, by contrast with chocolate, has a long tradition in cocktail making. It\u2019s a key ingredient in the early 20th century drink the Sidecar, as well as the drink that appears to have descended from both the Sidecar and Crusta tradition, the Margarita. In both it\u2019s a connecting element between the spirit and citrus juice. In your Baileys Chocolate Orange you combine two delicious chocolate and orange liqueurs.

Our take on the occasion is this fabulous Thanks for the Memories cocktail. The traditional Thanksgiving meal has a main dish of turkey with cranberry sauce, followed by pumpkin pie. We skipped out the turkey bones, but have added a hint of cranberry sauce to give a delicious fruity edge to the drink. Plus there\u2019s a dash of pumpkin pur\u00e9e to add richness and texture. And it\u2019s lengthened with a pour of orange, the mixer that\u2019s used in many classic American cocktails, including the Screwdriver.

It\u2019s a Bonfire Night take on the classic Margarita, with a sugared rim instead of salted for a fun version of this ideal party serve. The tradition of salting the rim of a cocktail glass actually derives from originally sugaring it in the manner of Light my Fire. Joseph Santina, a bartender working at Jewel of the South on Gravier Street in New Orleans invented the style sometime in the 1840s or 1850s, using fine, white sugar and taking the sugar a little way down the side of the glass as well as on the rim itself. It was a solution to the problem of sweetening a drink without leaving big grains of sugar \u2013 before the invention of sugar syrup, the sugar didn\u2019t dissolve unless the drink was heated. So Santina came up with the sugared rim and named it the \u2018Crusta\u2019, a cocktail that\u2019s been called \u201cthe absolute pinnacle of the nineteenth-century bartender\u2019s art\u201d by cocktail expert David Wondrich.

Pimm\u2019s Cider Cup is the latest in the historic line of Pimm\u2019s \u2018Cups\u2019 \u2013 to date these have been based on gin, scotch, brandy, rum, rye and vodka. The first was created by James Pimm in the 1840s by adding a secret blend of flavours and spices to gin. Sold in his London restaurants, he found people loved them. However it was former London mayor Horatio Davies, who took on the Pimm\u2019s company and its five restaurants and helped make Pimm\u2019s central to British life. By the next century Pimm\u2019s was being enjoyed across the British Empire. However we don\u2019t expect you to travel to Khartoum for a taste of history \u2013 Pimm\u2019s Cider Cup is just as good served up with friends at a barbecue, picnic or party.

Talisker is the only distillery on the island of Skye, first built in 1830 with a pier constructed in 1900 and new copper mash tuns (a vat in which malt is mashed) in the late 1990s. Its partner, Lillet Blanc, is an aperitif wine from Podensac, a small village just south of Bordeaux in France. Nowadays it is used as a substitute for Kina Lillet in the Vesper Martini cocktail because Kina Lillet, a vermouth from the same company is no longer in production. Lillet Blanc is a blend of wine made from the Semillon grape, mostly from the Bordeaux region, liqueur from sweet and bitter orange peel and quinine liqueur made from Peruvian Cinchona bark.

We\u2019ve used whisky in homage to the fact that the Highball was likely first made with the delicious brown spirit by bar owner Patrick Duffy, for the growing number of British actors working in New York in the late 19th century.

A highball was a ball connected to a float inside a steam train\u2019s water tank that indicated that there was enough water for the train to move off.

Most experts credit Cheryl Cook with formulating and naming the modern Cosmopolitan in the 1980s. Most also agree that Dale DeGroff transformed Cook's Cosmopolitan into the tart, fruity drink we know today, and that Toby Cecchini had a similar idea. The key to the Cosmo is balance, which will vary according to your choice of base vodka. Smirnoff No. 21 has a crisp flavour profile that brings out the zinging fruit of the cranberry juice. Smirnoff Lime adds a fruit explosion, or use Ketel One for citrus and honeyed flavours, or even C\u00eeroc for a subtler hint of fruit. Good quality cranberry juice is also critical.

So Gelsthorpe decided to innovate, firstly by releasing new mixed cranberry drinks, and secondly by marketing cranberry juice for use in cocktails. Cranberry paired naturally with vodka, and one of the first drinks introduced was the Cape Codder, a blend of vodka and cranberry, today also known as the New Yorker. The The Sea Breeze rapidly followed, as did the Bay Breeze (vodka, cranberry and pineapple) and the Madras (vodka, cranberry and orange); the 1980\u2019s favourite Sex on the Beach is a Madras with peach schnapps, while a Woo Woo is a Cape Codder with peach schnapps. When Ocean Spray exported its cranberry juice drinks to Europe, beginning in the early 1990s, the Breeze craze began: 1990\u2019s London cocktail bars would offer Breezes based on everything from rum to absinthe, although these drinks have not stood the test of time. The clean taste of Smirnoff No. 21 pairs perfectly with the Sea Breeze and its siblings.

The cocktail grew quickly in popularity, helped by some nifty marketing work by Galliano salesman George Bednar, peaking in the 1970s where it was a staple on many bars across the world \u2013 not just on the West Coast of the US. It has enjoyed a recent resurgence since Galliano returned to its original recipe. The classic Harvey Wallbanger is made by mixing Smirnoff No.21 Vodka and orange juice in a Highball glass with ice. Then slowly pour a measure of Galliano Liqueur onto the liquid so that the liqueur \u2018floats\u2019 on the surface of the drink. The visual punch is completed with a garnish of a maraschino cherry and a slice of orange.

You can also create an upside down version of the Madras by pouring orange juice over ice cubes and then topping with the cranberry juice and vodka.

The Screwdriver sits alongside the better-known Bloody Mary, Moscow Mule and Vodka Martini as one of four classic cocktails that pushed Smirnoff No. 21, and the previously unknown category of vodka, to dominate the global drinking scene. Before World War II, fresh orange juice was only available in season, while canned juices tasted very different from the real thing. The Screwdriver benefited from new, better-tasting packaged orange juice that arrived in the late 1940s. The name, a carefully masculine title for what could otherwise have been perceived as a feminine drink, supposedly derives from wildcatters drilling exploration oil wells in (variously) California, Texas, Persia or Saudi Arabia. Feeling parched in the desert, the oilmen would stir vodka into their orange juice using the only available tool \u2013 a screwdriver. The Screwdriver travelled fast. Creatively promoted in Los Angeles, by 1949 it was on the menus in bars as far afield as Turkey; by the 1960s it was a standard bar call. The key to this classic combination is good quality orange juice, ideally freshly squeezed, which allows the clean taste of Smirnoff No. 21 to shine through.

It was made using gin and, because grapefruit juice was not widely available at the time, the original version got its sweet citrus flavour from grapefruit jelly. The Greyhound still exists in its original, gin-based form, and with the addition of salt around the rim of the glass, you can serve a Salty Dog. But by the 1950s the cocktail had evolved into a vodka-based drink and its popularity grew throughout the 1960s, thanks to the more ready availability of grapefruit juice. The drink fell out of fashion during the 1980s and 1990s but today it is appreciated once more as a sharp, early evening drink to be enjoyed with friends. Less sour than a Bloody Mary and more piquant than a Mimosa, the Greyhound strikes the perfect balance.

American president Franklin Delano Roosevelt chose the Dirty martini as his first drink on the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. Roosevelt also offered it to Stalin and Churchill during peace talks in the 1940s. It was at that time a gin-based cocktail, but the Dirty martini is now often served with Smirnoff No.21 Vodka.

It then appeared in TV series such as US sitcom Two and a Half Men and 2009\u2019s Community on NBC, as well as How I Met Your Mother. And then in 2010, it had the endorsement of the world\u2019s most famous social network. In the film The Social Network, Napster co-founder Sean Parker buys a round of Appletinis for Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, Facebook co-founders at their first meeting. In reality, although this meeting happened, they didn\u2019t drink Appletinis. However, after seeing the film Zuckerberg made the Appletini the official drink of Facebook. Like a regular vodka martini, the cocktail starts with Smirnoff No.21, but then you add the sour mix and apple juice to create an Appletini. It\u2019s shaken over ice and served in a chilled glass. Some recipes add vermouth to bring it closer to the martini original, some sour apple schnapps, which gives the cocktail a vivid green colour. Other variants use cider or other apple liqueurs to provide an orchard fruit flavour. A more complex version adds Calvados and Grand Marnier for a mixed fruit martini.

The Kamikaze is made with equal parts vodka, Orange Liqueur and lime juice, shaken with ice and strained into a chilled Highball or martini glass and garnished with a wedge or twist of lime. The most common adjustment to this recipe is increasing the amount of Smirnoff No.21 Vodka, but be sure that you maintain the tart balance of the lime juice as you add more base spirit. The Kamikaze can also be made with a great tequila, such as Don Julio Blanco, which takes it close to a Margarita. It\u2019s why the shot version of the cocktail is sometimes known as a \u2018bite-sized Margarita\u2019. The Blue Kamikaze is a tropical twist, made with the addition of Blue Cura\u00e7ao and a dash of coconut liqueur for a colourful, exotic mix.

Two more plausible candidates are \u201cA man named Black who kept a place ten doors below Houston Street on Broadway\u201d in the 1860s according to William F. Mulhall, a bartender who plied his trade at New York\u2019s famed Hoffman House. Or there\u2019s the story that it was a certain Colonel Joe Walker, who ran one of the most notorious saloons in New Orleans, the Crescent Hall Saloon. He is supposed to have created the drink on a yachting trip with friends in New York. The first Manhattans were almost certainly made with rye whisky. In the aftermath of Prohibition, bourbon became popular. Too much peat, however, can overpower the drink, which is why classic blended whiskies with a balance of flavours are ideal: Johnnie Walker Black Label, Bells, J&B and Bushmills make a fine Manhattan. Variations on the Manhattan are myriad. The Dry Manhattan is made with dry vermouth; the Perfect Manhattan is made with a mixture of sweet and dry vermouths.

But you\u2019ll find adding in the juice balances the Pink Lady perfectly. Reputedly enjoyed by 1940s Hollywood actress Jayne Mansfield, and titled after Ivan Caryll\u2019s 1911 Broadway musical of the same name, the Pink Gin has glamour in spades. But there\u2019s another side to this great cocktail \u2013 it gained prominence during Prohibition because the other ingredients masked the poor flavour of the cheap gin of the time. You can reference the better part of its history by using delicious modern gin botanicals enhanced by the grenadine or pomegranate syrup, and given added texture by egg white. In the 1920s a version of the Pink Lady emerged with cream, known in New Orleans as the Pink Shimmy. It was this drink, along with many Pink Lady versions without lemon juice that led Esquire magazine to list the Pink Lady among its 10 worst cocktails in 1934.

Shortly after the invention of the Tom Collins, the Fizz appeared. It was the forerunner of The Gin Fizz, first referenced in Jerry Thomas\u2019 classic 1887 Bartenders\u2019 Guide and growing in popularity in the US through the first part of the 20th century. Largely unhindered by prohibition, the Gin Fizz continued to be mixed well into the 1930s, before gaining wider acclaim internationally. One of the best-known versions of the Gin Fizz recipe is the Ramos Gin Fizz, using orange flower water, invented by Henry Ramos in New Orleans in 1888. Another famous variant is the French 75, using sparkling wine instead of carbonated water.

It\u2019s the quinine that gives the G&T its characteristic, delicious and slightly bitter taste. The army of the British East India Company then developed a drink mixing the tonic with sugar, gin and lime, and the G&T was born. The G&T crops up in the book version of Dr No, where James Bond specifies exactly how to make a good G&T, in typical style. It also appears in Billy Joel\u2019s 1973 hit single Piano Man, and UK band Oasis mention the drink in their single Supersonic. Recently a boom for the G&T in Spain has led to the creation of Gin Tonica, a serving of the components in a balloon glass or coupe glass with plenty of ice. As with all the great mixed drinks, the make-up of a classic G&T is open to debate, however. The most popular tends to be one part gin to three parts tonic, poured over ice and garnished with squeezed lime wedges, but those who like to taste the subtle flavours of Tanqueray London Dry Gin may mix it one to one.

Prohibition to disguise the flavour of neat gin. Fast forward to the delicious botanical flavours of Tanqueray London Dry Gin and we\u2019re talking bold flavours on a subtle base that makes a very tasty, unusual mix. We love this version with gin instead of wintery brandy for a great year-round drink. Sometimes the offspring becomes more famous than its parent, as in the case of the Brandy Alexander, but the gin-based Alexander has refined, subtle flavour and less oak-aged sweetness too. Just make sure you give the cocktail a good shake to amalgamate the cream and spirit, and then strain. There are no pyrotechnics involved in making the Alexander cocktail recipe, but it can benefit from some grated nutmeg on top to finish. And, yes, there\u2019s history to back up the Alexander. The earliest citation of the cocktail came in Hugo Ensslin\u2019s 1916 Recipe for Mixed Drinks, with the invention in all likelihood coming a year earlier, named after Philadelphia baseball pitcher Grove Cleveland Alexander, who played in the 1915 World Series against Boston. Reputedly a head bartender at local outlet The Racquet Club created the drink to commemorate the contest. The alternative story of origin has it that a bartender called Troy Alexander at New York restaurant Rector\u2019s created the drink for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. It\u2019s a slightly unusual tale, but essentially the white colour from the use of cream in the cocktail was supposed to symbolise the cleanliness of passengers when they travelled with this company, because Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad was one of the first companies to use anthracite instead of coal to fire their trains.

'bar spoon turmeric',mixer,lauren,"Turmeric (Curcuma longa; /ËˆtÉœËêrmÉ™rÉªk/ or variously /ËˆtjuËêmÉ™rÉªk/[2]) is a flowering plant of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, the roots of which are used in cooking.[3] The plant is rhizomatous, herbaceous, and perennial, and is native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, and requires temperatures between 20 and 30 Â°C (68 and 86 Â°F) and a considerable amount of annual rainfall to thrive. Plants are gathered each year for their rhizomes, some for propagation in the following season and some for consumption. When not used fresh, the rhizomes are boiled in water for about 30â€“45 minutes and then dried in hot ovens, after which they are ground into a deep orange-yellow powder commonly used as a coloring and flavoring agent in many Asian cuisines, especially for curries, as well as for dyeing.[4] Turmeric powder has a warm, bitter, black pepper-like flavor and earthy, mustard-like aroma.[5][6]",,

'almond syrup',mixer,lauren,"Historically, almond syrup was an emulsion of sweet and bitter almonds, usually made with barley syrup (orgeat syrup) or in a syrup of orange flower water and sugar, often flavored with a synthetic aroma of almonds.[40] Orgeat syrup is an important ingredient in the Mai Tai and many other Tiki drinks.[50][51][52] Due to the cyanide found in bitter almonds, modern syrups generally are produced only from sweet almonds. Such syrup products do not contain significant levels of hydrocyanic acid, so are generally considered safe for human consumption.",,
'apple cider',mixer,lauren,"Apple cider (also called sweet cider or soft cider or simply cider) is the name used in the United States and parts of Canada for an unfiltered, unsweetened, non-alcoholic beverage made from apples. Though typically referred to simply as ""cider"" in those areas, it is not to be confused with the alcoholic beverage known as cider throughout most of the world, called hard cider in the US. It is the liquid extracted from an apple and all its components, that is then boiled to concentration. The liquid can be extracted from the apple itself, the apple core, the trimmings from apples, or apple culls. Once pressed mainly at farmsteads and local mills, apple cider is easy and inexpensive to make.[1] It is typically opaque due to fine apple particles in suspension and generally tangier than commercial filtered apple juice, but this depends on the variety of apples used.[2] Cider is typically pasteurized to kill bacteria and extend its shelf life, but untreated cider is common. In either form, apple cider is seasonally produced in autumn.[3] It is traditionally served on the Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and various New Year's Eve holidays, sometimes heated and mulled.",,
'apple juice',mixer,lauren,"Apple juice is a fruit juice made by the maceration and pressing of an apple. The resulting expelled juice may be further treated by enzymatic and centrifugal clarification to remove the starch and pectin, which holds fine particulate in suspension, and then pasteurized for packaging in glass, metal or aseptic processing system containers, or further treated by dehydration processes to a concentrate. Due to the complex and costly equipment required to extract and clarify juice from apples in large volume, apple juice is normally produced commercially. In the United States, unfiltered fresh apple juice is made by smaller operations in areas of high apple production, in the form of unclarified apple cider. Apple juice is one of the most common fruit juices in the world, with world production led by China, Poland, the United States, and Germany",,
'apple purÃ©e',mixer,lauren,"Apples are first selected based on ripeness, texture, natural sweetness and tartness/acidity.

'apricot jam',mixer,lauren,"This recipe yields a very chunky, rustic jam that relies entirely on the fruit's natural pectin, in concert with sugar, lemon juice, and heat, to set perfectly. This jam works well with Blenheim apricots, or any other small, freestone apricot (apricots that have pits that pop out easily, rather than clinging to the flesh). If you have particularly firm or large apricots, or you would just like a jam with a more refined texture, feel free to macerate the apricot halves in the sugar at room temperature overnight before proceeding with the recipe.",,

'bacon lardons',mixer,lauren,"A lardon, also called lardoon or larding, is a small strip or cube of fatty bacon, or pork fat (usually subcutaneous fat) used in a wide variety of cuisines to flavor savory foods and salads. In French cuisine, lardons are also used for larding, by threading them with a needle into meats that are to be braised or roasted. Lardons are not normally smoked, and they are made from pork that has been cured with salt. The Oxford English Dictionary defines ""lardon"" as ""one of the pieces of bacon or pork which are inserted in meat in the process of larding"", giving primacy to that process.[1] According to the Middle English Dictionary, the earliest occurrence of the word is in 1381, in the work Pegge Cook; it advises to insert lardons in cranes and herons.[2]",,

'black pepper',mixer,lauren,"Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, cultivated for its fruit, known as a peppercorn, which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning. When fresh and fully mature, it is about 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter and dark red, and contains a single seed, like all drupes. Peppercorns and the ground pepper derived from them may be described simply as pepper, or more precisely as black pepper (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green pepper (dried unripe fruit), or white pepper (ripe fruit seeds). Ground dried and cooked peppercorns have been used since antiquity, both for flavour and as a traditional medicine. Black pepper is the world's most traded spice, and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world. Its spiciness is due to the chemical compound piperine, which is a different kind of spicy from the capsaicin characteristic of chili peppers. It is ubiquitous in the modern world as a seasoning, and is often paired with salt and available on dining tables in shakers.",,
'boiling water',mixer,lauren,"Boiling is the rapid vaporization of a liquid, which occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding atmosphere. There are two main types of boiling: nucleate boiling where small bubbles of vapour form at discrete points, and critical heat flux boiling where the boiling surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and a film of vapor forms on the surface. Transition boiling is an intermediate, unstable form of boiling with elements of both types. The boiling point of water is 100 Â°C or 212 Â°F but is lower with the decreased atmospheric pressure found at higher altitudes. Boiling is also used in cooking. Foods suitable for boiling include vegetables, starchy foods such as rice, noodles and potatoes, eggs, meats, sauces, stocks, and soups. As a cooking method, it is simple and suitable for large-scale cookery. Tough meats or poultry can be given a long, slow cooking and a nutritious stock is produced. Disadvantages include loss of water-soluble vitamins and minerals. Commercially prepared foodstuffs are sometimes packed in polythene sachets and sold as ""boil-in-the-bag"" products.",,
'brown sugar',mixer,lauren,"Brown sugar is a sucrose sugar product with a distinctive brown color due to the presence of molasses.

The Codex Alimentarius requires brown sugar to contain at least 88% of sucrose plus invert sugar.[1] Commercial brown sugar contains from 3.5% molasses (light brown sugar) to 6.5% molasses (dark brown sugar) based on total volume.[2] Based on total weight, regular commercial brown sugar contains up to 10% molasses.[3] The product is naturally moist from the hygroscopic nature of the molasses and is often labelled as ""soft."" The product may undergo processing to give a product that flows better for industrial handling. The addition of dyes or other chemicals may be permitted in some areas or for industrial products.",,
"'""'butter, melted'""",mixer,lauren,"Butter (/ËˆbÊŒtÉ™/) is a dairy product with high butterfat content which is solid when chilled and at room temperature in some regions, and liquid when warmed. It is made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk to separate the butterfat from the buttermilk. It is generally used as a spread on plain or toasted bread products and a condiment on cooked vegetables, as well as in cooking, such as baking, sauce making, and pan frying. Butter consists of butterfat, milk proteins and water, and often added salt. Most frequently made from cow's milk, butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks. Salt (such as dairy salt), flavorings (such as garlic) and preservatives are sometimes added to butter. Rendering butter, removing the water and milk solids, produces clarified butter or ghee, which is almost entirely butterfat. Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream, where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers. Butter remains a firm solid when refrigerated, but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature, and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32 to 35 Â°C (90 to 95 Â°F). The density of butter is 911 grams per Litre (0.950 lb per US pint).[1] It generally has a pale yellow color, but varies from deep yellow to nearly white. Its natural, unmodified color is dependent on the source animal's feed and genetics, but the commercial manufacturing process commonly manipulates the color with food colorings like annatto[2] or carotene.",,

Ground dried and cooked peppercorns have been used since antiquity, both for flavour and as a traditional medicine. Black pepper is the world's most traded spice, and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world.

Cloves are harvested at 1.5â€“2.0 cm long, and consist of a long calyx that terminates in four spreading sepals, and four unopened petals that form a small central ball.UsesDried clovesClove tree flowersCloves are used in the cuisine of Asian, African, and the Near and Middle East countries, lending flavor to meats, curries, and marinades, as well as fruit such as apples, pears or rhubarb. Cloves may be used to give aromatic and flavor qualities to hot beverages, often combined with other ingredients such as lemon and sugar. They are a common element in spice blends such as pumpkin pie spice and speculoos spices.In Mexican cuisine, cloves are best known as clavos de olor, and often accompany cumin and cinnamon.[3] They are also used in Peruvian cuisine, in a wide variety of dishes as carapulcra and arroz con leche.A major component of clove taste is imparted by the chemical eugenol,[4] and the quantity of the spice required is typically small. It pairs well with cinnamon, allspice, vanilla, red wine and basil, as well as onion, citrus peel, star anise, or peppercorns.Non-culinary usesThe spice is used in a type of cigarette called kretek in Indonesia.[1] Clove cigarettes have been smoked throughout Europe, Asia and the United States. Starting in 2009, clove cigarettes must be classified as cigars in the US.[5]Because of the bioactive chemicals of clove, the spice may be used as an ant repellent.[6]Cloves can be used to make a fragrance pomander when combined with an orange. When given as a gift in Victorian England, such a pomander indicated warmth of feeling.Cloves used in an orange as a pomanderCloves drying in sunPotential medicinal uses and adverse effectsThough long-used in traditional medicine, there is little evidence that clove oil containing eugenol is effective for toothache pain or other types of pain,[7][8] although one review reported efficacy of eugenol combined with zinc oxide as an analgesic for alveolar osteitis.[9] Studies to determine its effectiveness for fever reduction, as a mosquito repellent, and to prevent premature ejaculation have been inconclusive.[7][8] It remains unproven whether using cloves or clove oil reduces blood sugar levels.[8] Use of clove for any medicinal purpose has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and its use may cause adverse effects if taken orally by people with liver disease, blood clotting and immune system disorders, or food allergies.[7]",,

Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.[1]The first chocolate drink is believed to have been created by the Mayans around 2,500-3,000 years ago, and a cocoa drink was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD, by which they referred to as xocÅçlÄÅtl.[2][3] The drink became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the New World and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was even used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.Hot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced chocolate para mesa of Latin America, the very thick cioccolata calda served in Italy and chocolate a la taza served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States.

'honey',mixer,sindoori,"Honey is a sweet, viscous food substance produced by bees and some related insects.[1] Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants (floral nectar) or from secretions of other insects (such as honeydew), by regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. Bees store honey in wax structures called a honeycomb.[1][2] The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus Apis) is the best-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption.[3] Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from hives of domesticated bees, a practice known as beekeeping or apiculture.Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose (granulated sugar).[4][5] It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener.[4] Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years.[6][7]Honey provides 46 calories in a serving of one tablespoon (15 ml).[8] Honey is regarded as safe when not taken in excessive amounts.[9]Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity. Several cave paintings in Cuevas de la AraÃ±a, Spain, depict humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago.[10][11]",,
'horseradish',mixer,sindoori,"Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana, syn. Cochlearia armoracia) is a perennial plant of the family Brassicaceae (which also includes mustard, wasabi, broccoli, and cabbage). It is a root vegetable used as a spice and prepared as a condiment.The plant is probably native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is popular worldwide. It grows up to 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) tall, and is cultivated primarily for its large, white, tapered root.[2][3][4][5]The intact horseradish root has hardly any aroma. When cut or grated enzymes from the now-broken plant cells break down sinigrin (a glucosinolate) to produce allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil), which irritates the mucous membranes of the sinuses and eyes. Grated mash should be used immediately or preserved in vinegar for best flavor. Once exposed to air or heat it will begin to lose its pungency, darken in color, and become unpleasantly bitter tasting over time.The distinctive pungent taste of horseradish is from the compound allyl isothiocyanate. Upon crushing the flesh of horseradish, the enzyme myrosinase is released and acts on the glucosinolates sinigrin and gluconasturtiin, which are precursors to the allyl isothiocyanate. The allyl isothiocyanate serves the plant as a natural defense against herbivores. Since allyl isothiocyanate is harmful to the plant itself, it is stored in the harmless form of the glucosinolate, separate from the myrosinase enzyme. When an animal chews the plant, the allyl isothiocyanate is released, repelling the animal.[17] Allyl isothiocyanate is an unstable compound, degrading over the course of days at 37 Â°C (99 Â°F).[18] Because of this instability, horseradish sauces lack the pungency of the freshly crushed roots.Cooks use the terms ""horseradish"" or ""prepared horseradish"" to refer to the grated root of the horseradish plant mixed with vinegar. Prepared horseradish is white to creamy-beige in color. It can be stored for months under refrigeration, but eventually will darken, indicating it is losing flavour and should be replaced. The leaves of the plant, while edible, are not commonly eaten, and are referred to as ""horseradish greens"", which have a flavor similar to that of the roots.",,

'ice cream',mixer,sindoori,"Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice)[1] is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from dairy milk or cream, or soy, cashew, coconut or almondmilk, and is flavored with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice, such as cocoa or vanilla. Colourings are usually added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 Â°C or 35 Â°F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.The meaning of the name ""ice cream"" varies from one country to another. Terms such as ""frozen custard,"" ""frozen yogurt,"" ""sorbet,"" ""gelato,"" and others are used to distinguish different varieties and styles. In some countries, such as the United States, ""ice cream"" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream.[2] Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled ""frozen dessert"" instead.[3] In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.Ice cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible cones.

'iced tea',mixer,sindoori,"Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub (bush) native to East Asia.[3] After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.[4] There are many different types of tea; some, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,[5] while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral or grassy notes.Tea originated in Southwest China during the Shang dynasty, where it was used as a medicinal drink.[6] An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the 3rd century AD, in a medical text written by Hua Tuo.[7] It was popularized as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century.[8] During the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among Britons, who started large-scale production and commercialization of the plant in India. Combined, China and India supplied 62% of the world's tea in 2016.The term herbal tea refers to drinks not made from Camellia sinensis: infusions of fruit, leaves, or other parts of the plant, such as steeps of rosehip, chamomile, or rooibos.

'jasmine tea',mixer,sindoori,"Jasmine tea (Chinese: èŒ‰è_‰è_±èŒ¶; pinyin: mÃ_lÃ¬huÄÅ chÃ¡) is tea scented with the aroma of jasmine blossoms. Typically, jasmine tea has green tea as the tea base; however, white tea and black tea are also used. The resulting flavour of jasmine tea is subtly sweet and highly fragrant. It is the most famous scented tea in China.[1]The jasmine plant is believed to have been introduced into China from eastern South Asia via India during the Han Dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD),[2] and was being used to scent tea around the fifth century.[2] However, jasmine tea did not become widespread until the Qing Dynasty (1644 to 1912 AD), when tea started to be exported in large quantities to the West. Nowadays, it's still a common drink served in tea shops around the world.The jasmine plant is grown at high elevations in the mountains. Jasmine tea produced in the Chinese province of Fujian has the best reputation.[1] Jasmine tea is also produced in the provinces of Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Zhejiang.[1] Japan is also known for the production of jasmine tea, especially in Okinawa Prefecture, where it is called Sanpin-cha (ãÅ•ã‚“ãÅ´ã‚“èŒ¶).Modern biological studies have shown that drinking jasmine tea can have health and immunity benefits. Jasmine tea contains several different kinds of antioxidants that provide protection to the membranes of red blood cells; this added protection helps fend off free radical-induced oxidation of the red blood cells.[3]PreparationTea leaves are harvested in the early spring and stored until the late summer when fresh jasmine flowers are in bloom. Jasmine flowers are picked early in the day when the small petals are tightly closed. The flowers are kept cool until nightfall. During the night, jasmine flowers open, releasing their fragrance. This is when the tea scenting takes place. There are two main methods used to scent the tea with the jasmine.[4] In one method the tea and flowers are placed in alternating layers;[5] in the other, the tea is blended with jasmine flowers and stored overnight.[2] It takes over four hours for the tea to absorb the fragrance and flavour of the jasmine blossoms. The scenting process may be repeated as many as six or seven times for top grades such as Yin Hao.[2] The tea absorbs moisture from the fresh Jasmine flowers so it must be dried again to prevent spoilage.Cultural usesIn northern China it is customary to serve Jasmine tea as a welcoming gesture to guests.[1] Jasmine tea is the local tea beverage of Fuzhou, while jasmine flowers are the municipal flower of that city.Jasmine has symbolic meanings in the Chinese culture. This flower is not only the symbol of forever love but also one of the holy flowers of Buddhism. For example, the crown of the Buddhist in the Ajanta wall paintings, a world heritage site, is decorated by golden jasmine flowers. The fragrance of jasmines is thought to be of heaven. In the past, people in Fuzhou considered tea as an antidote to a lot of poisons. In the Fuzhou dialect, the word for buying medicine literally means buying tea; brewing medicine, brewing tea; taking medicine, drinking tea. In addition, tea culture is important by shaping the art of drinking tea which follows different steps.[6]Fuzhou Jasmine TeaFuzhou, the capital city of Fujian, is the most important city in producing jasmine tea in China.[7] The city is built at a river basin and surrounded by mountains. The climate in Fuzhou is mild, rainfall is abundant and the day-night temperature difference is obvious, creating favorable conditions for jasmine flowers to grow. And there is also the microclimate needed for tea trees -- jasmines are planted near rivers, while tea trees grow on slopes 600 to 1,000 meters above the sea level.[8] Fuzhou has 1,200 hectares of tea gardens and last year it produced 110,000 tons of jasmine tea, worth 1.78 billion yuan ($290 million).[9]After the jasmine plant was introduced into Fuzhou, people planted the flower broadly. During 1368-1644, the Northern Song Dynasty, Fuzhou gained the name of ""The City of Jasmine in China"". Fuzhou is regarded as the origin of the jasmine tea production process, and so far it is the only city to contain the complete production process. The jasmine tea making process started from the Tang Dynasty and had a great change in the Ming Dynasty. Before 1937, the development of Fuzhou Jasmine tea was fast and products were sold to many regions. Because of the war, the output dropped quickly. During 1950s-1990s the industry revived and reached 60% of the total national production, but after that, it fell again.The government is still working on reviving Fuzhou jasmine tea. In recent years, the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and government strove to protect and develop the system of Fuzhou jasmine planting and tea culture, and took active measures to cultivate good stock and applied for the heritage list.[10]The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations awarded the ""Fuzhou jasmine tea and tea culture system"" as one of the ""Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems"". [11] Experts from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations specially went to Fuzhou to inspect the Fuzhou Jasmine Planting and Tea Culture System on April 5. After the visit, it was awarded the â€œGlobally Important Agricultural Heritage Systemâ€ù title in Rome, Italy, on April 29, 2014.",,

Maple syrup is generally low in overall micronutrient content, although manganese and riboflavin are at high levels along with moderate amounts of zinc and calcium (right table). It also contains trace amounts of amino acids which increase in content as sap flow occurs.[72] Maple syrup contains a wide variety of volatile organic compounds, including vanillin, hydroxybutanone, and propionaldehyde. It is not yet known exactly what compounds are responsible for maple syrup's distinctive flavour,[33] however its primary flavour contributing compounds are maple furanone, strawberry furanone, and maltol.[73] New compounds have been identified in maple syrup, one of which is quebecol, a natural phenolic compound created when the maple sap is boiled to create syrup.[74] One author described maple syrup as ""a unique ingredient, smooth- and silky-textured, with a sweet, distinctive flavour â€“ hints of caramel with overtones of toffee will not do â€“ and a rare colour, amber set alight.

They can also be used to flavour a variety of foods, including fritters, ice cream, hot cereal, fresh fruit, and sausages.

Simply Orange Simply Orange tasted quite a bit like the stuff you get at the mess hall at camp, but again, it's not bad. While not particularly robust, with a bit of a chemical tang in the aftertaste. Still, it wasn't too sweet and had that bitter, almost rind-y quality that makes it seem closer to the fruit itself.

Full-bodied, sweet, and with a bitterness that makes it taste straight from the fruit, I'm not sure anyone would guess it was bottled and not just squeezed. The only deterrent? It had slighly less pulp than I'd want from a fresh OJ. Kennesaw Kennesaw, on the other hand, was perfect. On my notes, I wrote ""Real. Deal.""

'soy sauce',mixer,claire,"The taste of soy sauce is predominated by saltiness, followed by moderate umami, sweet taste, and finally slight bitterness, which is hard to perceive due to the masking effect of other tastes. The overall flavor of soy sauce is a result of the balance and interaction among different taste components. The saltiness is largely attributed to the presence of NaCl (common salt) in brine. The sugars hydrolyzed from starch add sweetness into soy sauce. Umami is largely caused by the presence of free amino acids. Besides, the interaction between glutamine and sodium cation may have given rise to sodium glutamate (MSG), which can further contribute to the umami flavor. Basic tastes can also be attributed to amino acids groups arranged in specific sequence. In soy sauce, it was found that ""amino acids were grouped as MSG-like (monosodium glutamate-like) (Asp+Glu), sweet (Ala+Gly+Ser+Thr), bitter (Arg+His+Ile+Leu+Met+Phe+Trp+Try+Val), and tasteless (Cys+Lys+Pro)"".[37]Despite a large variety of volatile and odorant compounds that have been identified in soy sauce, the food product per se does not present a strong aroma. Alcohols, acids, esters, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, heterocyclic compounds, alkynes and benzenes are identified in Chinese soy sauces.[33] An explanation for this observation is that the aroma of soy sauce does not depend largely on the aroma-active compounds. The subtle aroma is a result of a ""critical balance"" achieved among all volatile and odorant compounds, whose respective concentrations are relatively low.",,

'sparkling water',mixer,claire,"Carbonated water or soda water is water containing dissolved carbon dioxide gas, either artificially injected under pressure or occurring due to natural geological processes. Carbonation causes small bubbles to form, giving the water an effervescent quality. Common forms include sparkling natural mineral water, club soda, and commercially produced sparkling water (also known as 'seltzer water' in the U.S.).Club soda, sparkling mineral water, seltzer and many other sparkling waters contain added or dissolved minerals such as potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, or potassium sulfate. These occur naturally in some mineral waters but are also commonly added artificially to man-made waters to mimic a natural flavor profile. Various carbonated waters are sold in bottles and cans, with some also produced on demand by commercial carbonation systems in bars and restaurants, or made at home using a carbon dioxide cartridge.It is thought the first person to aerate water with carbon dioxide was William Brownrigg in 1740, although he never published a paper.[1] Carbonated water was independently accidentally invented by Joseph Priestley in 1767 when he discovered a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide after suspending a bowl of water above a beer vat at a brewery in Leeds, England.[2] He wrote of the ""peculiar satisfaction"" he found in drinking it, and in 1772 he published a paper entitled Impregnating Water with Fixed Air.[3][4] Priestleyâ€™s apparatus, which featured a bladder between the generator and the absorption tank to regulate the flow of carbon dioxide, was soon joined by a wide range of others, but it wasnâ€™t until 1781 that carbonated water began being produced on a large scale with the establishment of companies specialized in producing artificial mineral water.[2] The first factory was built by Thomas Henry of Manchester, England.[2] Henry replaced the bladder in Priestleyâ€™s system with large bellows.[2]While Priestley is regarded as â€œthe father of the soft drink,â€ù he did not benefit financially from his invention.[2] He did however receive scientific recognition when the Council of the Royal Society â€œwere moved to reward its discoverer with the Copley Medalâ€ù in 1772.[5]",,
'split vanilla pod',mixer,claire,"Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (V. planifolia). The word vanilla, derived from vainilla, the diminutive of the Spanish word vaina (vaina itself meaning a sheath or a pod), is translated simply as ""little pod"".[1] Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called tlÄ«lxochitl by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.[2]Pollination is required to set the vanilla fruit from which the flavoring is derived. In 1837, Belgian botanist Charles FranÃ§ois Antoine Morren discovered this fact and pioneered a method of artificially pollinating the plant.[3] The method proved financially unworkable and was not deployed commercially.[4] In 1841, Edmond Albius, a slave who lived on the French island of RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean, discovered at the age of 12 that the plant could be hand-pollinated. Hand-pollination allowed global cultivation of the plant.[5]Vanilla tahitensis in cultivationThree major species of vanilla currently are grown globally, all of which derive from a species originally found in Mesoamerica, including parts of modern-day Mexico.[6] They are V. planifolia (syn. V. fragrans), grown on Madagascar, RÃ©union, and other tropical areas along the Indian Ocean; V. tahitensis, grown in the South Pacific; and V. pompona, found in the West Indies, Central America, and South America.[7] The majority of the world's vanilla is the V. planifolia species, more commonly known as Bourbon vanilla (after the former name of RÃ©union, Ã_le Bourbon) or Madagascar vanilla, which is produced in Madagascar and neighboring islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean, and in Indonesia. Combined, Madagascar and Indonesia produce two-thirds of the world's supply of vanilla.Vanilla is the second-most expensive spice after saffron[8][9] because growing the vanilla seed pods is labor-intensive.[9] Despite the expense, vanilla is highly valued for its flavor.[10] As a result, vanilla is widely used in both commercial and domestic baking, perfume manufacture, and aromatherapy.",,

"""'strong coffee, 'chilled'""",mixer,claire,"Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean.[2] Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are C. arabica and C. robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as ""beans"") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,[4] and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffÃ¨ latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative. Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption lowers the risk of some diseases, although those long-term studies are of generally poor quality.[5]The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines.[6] It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared. But the coffee seeds had to be first exported from East Africa to Yemen, as Coffea arabica is thought to have been indigenous to the former.[7] The Yemenis obtained their coffee via Somali traders from Berbera (who in turn procured the beans from the Ethiopian Highlands) and began to cultivate the seed. By the 16th century, the drink had reached Persia, Turkey, and North Africa. From there, it spread to Europe and the rest of the world.As of 2016, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing one-third of the world total. Coffee is a major export commodity, being the top legal agricultural export for numerous countries.[4][8][not in citation given] It is one of the most valuable commodities exported by developing countries. Green, unroasted coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world.[9] Some controversy has been associated with coffee cultivation and the way developed countries trade with developing nations, as well as the impact on the environment with regards to the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use. Consequently, the markets for fair trade and organic coffee are expanding, notably in the USA.[10]",,
'sugar or maple syrup',mixer,claire,"Maple syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, although it can also be made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.Maple syrup was first collected and used by the indigenous peoples of North America, and the practice was adopted by European settlers, who gradually refined production methods. Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing. The Canadian province of Quebec is by far the largest producer, responsible for 70 percent of the world's output; Canadian exports of maple syrup in 2016 were C$ 487 million (about US$ 360 million), with Quebec accounting for some 90 percent of this total.[1][2]Maple syrup is graded according to the Canada, United States, or Vermont scales based on its density and translucency. Sucrose is the most prevalent sugar in maple syrup. In Canada, syrups must be made exclusively from maple sap to qualify as maple syrup and must also be at least 66 percent sugar.[3] In the United States, a syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap to be labelled as ""maple"", though states such as Vermont and New York have more restrictive definitions.Maple syrup is often used as a condiment for pancakes, waffles, French toast, oatmeal or porridge. It is also used as an ingredient in baking and as a sweetener or flavouring agent. Culinary experts have praised its unique flavour, although the chemistry responsible is not fully understood.[4]",,

Its consistency is similar to that of molasses. The viscosity arises from the multiple hydrogen bonds between the dissolved sugar, which has many hydroxyl (OH) groups.Syrups can be made by dissolving sugar in water or by reducing naturally sweet juices such as cane juice, sorghum juice, maple sap or agave nectar.

'sugar',mixer,claire,"Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. The various types of sugar are derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. ""Table sugar"" or ""granulated sugar"" refers to sucrose, a disaccharide of glucose and fructose. In the body, sucrose is hydrolysed into fructose and glucose.Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants, but sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet, making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar. Sugarcane originated in tropical Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia,[1] and is known of from before 6,000 BP, sugar beet was first described in writing (1575) by Olivier de Serres and originated in southwestern, northern and Southeast Europe along the Atlantic coasts and the Mediterranean Sea, in North Africa, Macaronesia, to Western Asia. In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes. Other disaccharides include maltose (from malted grain) and lactose (from milk). Longer chains of sugar molecules are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. Some other chemical substances, such as glycerol and sugar alcohols, may have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugar.Sucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g. cookies and cakes), is sometimes added to commercially available beverages, and may be used by people as a sweetener for foods (e.g. toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g. coffee and tea). The average person consumes about 24 kilograms (53 lb) of sugar each year, or 33.1 kilograms (73 lb) in developed countries, equivalent to over 260 food calories per day. As sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high in sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to human health. Excessive consumption of sugar has been implicated in the onset of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and tooth decay. Numerous studies have tried to clarify those implications, but with varying results, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that consume little or no sugar. In 2015, the World Health Organization recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10%, and encouraged a reduction to below 5%, of their total energy intake.[2]",,

'unsalted butter',mixer,claire,"Butter (/ËˆbÊŒtÉ™/) is a dairy product with high butterfat content which is solid when chilled and at room temperature in some regions, and liquid when warmed. It is made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk to separate the butterfat from the buttermilk. It is generally used as a spread on plain or toasted bread products and a condiment on cooked vegetables, as well as in cooking, such as baking, sauce making, and pan frying. Butter consists of butterfat, milk proteins and water, and often added salt. Most frequently made from cow's milk, butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks. Salt (such as dairy salt), flavorings (such as garlic) and preservatives are sometimes added to butter. Rendering butter, removing the water and milk solids, produces clarified butter or ghee, which is almost entirely butterfat. Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream, where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers. Butter remains a firm solid when refrigerated, but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature, and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32 to 35 Â°C (90 to 95 Â°F). The density of butter is 911 grams per Litre (0.950 lb per US pint).[1] It generally has a pale yellow color, but varies from deep yellow to nearly white. Its natural, unmodified color is dependent on the source animal's feed and genetics, but the commercial manufacturing process commonly manipulates the color with food colorings like annatto[2] or carotene.",,

It's delicious and rich in flavour, with a smooth and creamy texture.While it's not the sort of thing I'd want to drink every day, this is perfect for special occasions (Christmas) or as a gift. It comes in a deluxe bottle, and looks very decorative.You get 500ml for about Â£15. This is expensive, when compared to standard Bailey's and the other flavoured Bailey's. For example, a 1lt bottle of orange Bailey's costs approx. Â£15 ... meaning that this chocolate flavoured drink is twice as expensive!Regardless of the cost, it's an extremely tasty liqueur - and I recommend it (for anyone who enjoys a rich chocolate flavour).9 people found this helpfulHelpfulComment Report abuse	M.

'champagne',alcohol,sindoori,"Champagne (/ÊƒÃ_mËˆpeÉªn/, French: [ÊƒÉ‘ÌƒpaÉ_]) is sparkling wine. Many people use the term Champagne as a generic term for sparkling wine but in some countries, it is illegal to label any product Champagne unless it both comes from the Champagne region and is produced under the rules of the appellation.[1] Specifically, in the EU countries, legally only that sparkling wine which comes from the Champagne region of France can be labelled as Champagne. Where EU law applies, this alcoholic drink is produced from grapes grown in the Champagne region of France following rules that demand, among other things, secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to create carbonation, specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes exclusively from specific parcels in the Champagne appellation and specific pressing regimes unique to the region.[2]Vineyards in the Champagne region of FrancePrimarily, the grapes Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, and Chardonnay are used in the production of almost all Champagne, but a tiny amount of pinot blanc, pinot gris, arbane, and petit meslier are vinified as well. Champagne appellation law allows only grapes grown according to appellation rules in specifically designated plots within the appellation to be used in the production of Champagne.Champagne became associated with royalty in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The leading manufacturers made efforts to associate their Champagnes with nobility and royalty through advertising and packaging, which led to popularity among the emerging middle class.[1] The most prestigious Champagne cellars are located in the cities of Reims and Epernay.

'chocolate liqueur',alcohol,sindoori,"Chocolate liqueur is a liqueur that tastes like chocolate.Contents1        History2        Recipes3        Uses4        Varieties4.1        Chocolate liqueur4.2        Chocolate cream liqueur4.3        CrÃ¨me de cacao5        See also6        ReferencesHistoryChocolate liqueur is not a new invention. There is mention, in French, of producing and selling chocolate en liqueur as early as 1666.[1] Context suggests this is a chocolate liqueur, not a chocolate liquor or other chocolate beverage. In New England prior to the 18th century American Revolution, a ""chocolate wine"" was popular. Its ingredients included sherry, port, chocolate, and sugar.[2] A French manual published in 1780 also describes chocolate liqueur.[3] An 1803 French pharmacy manual includes a recipe for a chocolate liqueur (ratafia de chocolat, also ratafia de cacao).[4] An early 19th-century American cookbook, published in 1825 and preserved in an historical archive in South Carolina, includes a similar recipe.[1] Throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th century, manuals and encyclopedias in French, English, and Spanish give similar recipes. A late 19th century food science manual gives a recipe that includes techniques for clarifying and coloring the liqueur.[5] A similar early 20th century manual gives four recipes.[6]There are several brands of chocolate liqueur on the market; this is attributed to a 1990s ""chocolate craze"".[2]RecipesEarly 19th century recipes for chocolate liqueur featured whole cocoa beans.[4] A basic modern recipe[7] for making chocolate liqueur at home lists the ingredients chocolate extract, vanilla extract, vodka, and simple syrup. To keep the chocolate extract in suspension and make the liqueur thicker, glycerine may be added. In its purest form, chocolate liqueur is clear; coloring may be added.[5] Recipes for home-made chocolate liqueurs may also include raw eggs as an ingredient, presenting a risk of salmonellosis. Reasonable safety may be achieved by combining the eggs with the alcohol before other ingredients.[8] Earlier, liquor was made by adding the cocoa beans to classic liqueur. Modern chocolate wine can be considered as a subspecies of chocolate liquor.[9]UsesChocolate liqueur can be consumed straight, as an after dinner drink rather than as aperitif. It is used in mixed drinks and in desserts, especially in dessert sauces, cakes, and truffles. A food writer notes that many recipes for chocolate truffle add a small amount of chocolate liqueur to melted chocolate, and warns that adding the liqueur often causes the chocolate to seize.[10] One of the more unusual uses is in chocolate rolled fondant.[11]Arguably the most controversial use may be in connection with a scandal concerning the provenance of certain 17th century bottles of wines said to have belonged to Thomas Jefferson, and traded by Hardy Rodenstock. Benjamin Wallace writes in his book The Billionaire's Vinegar that at a wine tasting of 19th century wines from ChÃ¢teau Latour, provided by Rodenstock, several people noted the wines had a flavor of chocolate liqueur and were fakes.[12] Wine and chocolate are a classic flavor pairing, and this is reflected in some cocktails that combine a strong red wine with a dash of chocolate liqueu",,

'coffee bitters',alcohol,sindoori,"Coffee has become a Saturday morning tradition for Kendall and me.  Before we walk to the market we meet at the best coffee shop in our neighborhood, Contraband, and pick up a couple Cappuccinos to go. Nice, strong espresso with a perfect pillow of frothed milk. Theyâ€™re heavenly. We donâ€™t drink them every Saturday to make us more alert or to get us energized. Although the caffeine is a positive side effect of the beverage, we drink coffee for the ritual and taste.  We drink our coffee slowly, enjoying each sipâ€”this is how I believe a cocktail should be enjoyed as well. For our second batch of bitters, we decided to go with coffee. Coffee is relaxing, it smells good, it tastes good, and it brings people togetherâ€_ who doesnâ€™t love it? A few dashes of Coffee Bitters in a whisky or rum cocktail just sounds like a recipe for happiness. The Coffee-Pecan Bitters recipe in Brad T. Parsonsâ€™ Bitters book inspires the recipe for my Coffee Bitters. If youâ€™re thinking about making your own bitters, or just want to learn some cool facts about bitters, I highly suggest reading it. IMG_2699.jpgTo make my Coffee Bitters, we combined Â_ cup cracked coffee beans, 4 cracked cacao beans, Â_ teaspoon of black peppercorns, Â_ teaspoon cassia chips, Â_ teaspoon wild cherry bark, and 2 star anise in a quart-sized mason jar. For the coffee beans, donâ€™t skimp on the quality. If you use crappy ingredients, youâ€™re going to have crappy bitters. We used Contrabandâ€™s Yemen coffee, which is a medium roast with a sweet and earthy flavorâ€”great stuff. We then drowned the coffee-bark-spice mixture in 2 cups of Wild Turkey 101 (the combination of the bourbon and coffee smells INCREDIBLE, by the way) and kept the jar at room temperature for 2 weeks, shaking the jar once a day.IMG_2742_2.JPGAfter the 2 weeks were up, we strained the liquid through cheesecloth to remove the solids, and then let the solids simmer in a saucepan with 1 cup of water for about 10 minutes. After it cooled, we put the contents of the saucepan in a separate mason jar and let it sit for another week, giving the jar a shake once a day. IMG_3027.jpgIMG_3039.jpgAfter waiting for another week, we strained out the solids and added the liquid to the other mason jar, which contained the original bourbon solution, along with 2 tablespoons of molasses. Three more days of waiting, one more run through cheesecloth, and finally, theyâ€™re done!",,

'french raspberry liqueur',alcohol,sindoori,"Chambord Liqueur (pronounced [ÊƒÉ‘Ìƒ.bÉ”ÊÅ]) is a 16.5% abv raspberry liqueur modelled after a liqueur produced in the Loire Valley of France during the late 17th century. The Chambord product brand has been owned and produced by the Brown-Forman Corporation since 2006.[1]Chambord is made from red and black raspberries, Madagascar vanilla, Moroccan citrus peel, honey and cognac.Contents1	History2	Production3	Bottle4	Cocktails5	Awards6	References7	External linksHistoryThe Chambord brand was founded in 1982.[2] The drink was inspired by raspberry liqueur made in the Loire Valley in the late 1600s,[2] said to have been introduced to Louis XIV during one of his visits to the chÃ¢teau de Chambord. It was common during that time for liqueurs and cognac to be consumed with elegant meals.In 2006, the Chambord product brand was acquired by the Brown-Forman Corporation.[1]ProductionChambord is produced in the Loire Valley from red and black raspberries, Madagascar vanilla, Moroccan citrus peel, honey and cognac. Whole raspberries and blackberries are steeped in French spirits for a period of several weeks to produce a fruit infusion.After the infusion is extracted, a second set of spirits is added to the fruit and allowed to rest for a few weeks. After this second infusion is drawn off, the remaining fruit is pressed to obtain the natural sugars and juice. The fruit-infused spirits and juices from the final pressing are then combined, and finally, the berry infusion is married with a proprietary blend of cognac, natural vanilla extract, black raspberries, citrus peel, honey, and herbs and spices. The liqueur is 16.5% alcohol by volume.BottleChambord comes in a spherical bottle. Until mid-2010, the bottle came with a metallic gold plastic lettered 'belt' around the middle, and a crown atop its lid. The bottle was modeled after a globus cruciger.In the U.S. market, the manufacturer began using a different bottle design in summer 2010, with modifications to the belt, lid and other elements.[3]In addition to redesigning the bottle for the traditional Chambord liqueur, the manufacturer has also begun using the Chambord brand name on a flavoured vodka.[3]CocktailsCommon drinks made from Chambord include the Raspberry Margarita, French Manhattan, Rolling Green (cocktail)[vodka,lemonade] Butler Miller (Chambord Vodka Gimlet),[4] Kir ImpÃ©rial (Chambord and champagne), Chambord Daiquiri, Chambord Royal Spritzer, Lemonado (Vodka, lemonade and splash of Chambord), Little Purple Men, The Purple Hooter Shooter, Sour Grapes, Black Opal, Peanut Butter and Jelly (with Frangelico or Castries Peanut Cream), Grape Crush, the ""Blood of Christ"", Grateful Dead, and the French Martini.

'guinessÂ®',alcohol,sindoori,"Guinness (/ËˆÉ¡ÉªnÉªs/) is a dark Irish dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness at St. James's Gate, Dublin, Ireland, in 1759. It is one of the most successful beer brands worldwide, brewed in almost 50 countries, and available in over 120. [1][2] Sales in 2011 amounted to 850 million litres (220,000,000 US gal).[1] It is popular with the Irish, both in Ireland and abroad. In spite of declining consumption since 2001,[3] it is still the best-selling alcoholic drink in Ireland.[4][5] where Guinness & Co. Brewery makes almost â‚¬2 billion worth annually.","Date: Gotta love illegible date codes, I think this is a late 2018 can, consumed on 03/28/19.Appearance: Pours out like a coke, then puts on a beautiful cascading act in the glass. Once this is finished, it takes on the traditional stout look with ruby color around the bottom. Guinness produces over two fingers of what has to be the most creamy sand colored head that a beer ever produced.Aroma: Roasted malts, light coffee, and chocolate are all on the nose with the malts actually seeming to have so depth to them. No one aspect is very pronounced, but it smell nice.Taste: Here is where we have some issues. First, Guinness is terribly thin, not a whole lot more substantial than water. The taste, while presenting a pleasant dry roasted bitter malt profile, never really amounts to much else. Yes, there is some chocolate and a mild coffee flavors, but this is a beer seems fearful of being what it should be. The widget in the can does give it a ridiculously creamy texture though. To sum Guinness up, it has been nice to revisit and old staple, but it simply cannot stand up to its craft brethren such as Deschutes Black Butte Porter. This St. Patrick's Day leftover reminds my why I only buy this once a year. 1,233 charactersDoghouseReilly3946, Apr 10, 2019Photo of mvhissom5/5  rDev +39.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5The perfect pint for every occasion.36 charactersmvhissom, Apr 10, 2019Photo of klastinger4.84/5  rDev +35.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75The pinnacle of stouts.23 charactersklastinger, Apr 01, 2019Photo of Daniel4734.5/5  rDev +25.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5It is great, when in drought take a draught.44 charactersDaniel473, Mar 31, 2019Photo of peterpunk153.1/5  rDev -13.4%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3peterpunk15, Mar 30, 2019Photo of StanCobb5/5  rDev +39.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5StanCobb, Mar 30, 2019Photo of LionHeart883/5  rDev -16.2%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3LionHeart88, Mar 29, 2019Photo of Bolli4.15/5  rDev +15.9%look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Bolli, Mar 25, 2019Photo of Beer_Rabbit663.71/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75Beer_Rabbit66, Mar 22, 2019Photo of PhineasMcClintock3.44/5  rDev -3.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5PhineasMcClintock, Mar 21, 2019Photo of M_chav2.09/5  rDev -41.6%look: 3 | smell: 2 | taste: 1.75 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.25M_chav, Mar 21, 2019Photo of MephistosCafe3.57/5  rDev -0.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5MephistosCafe, Mar 20, 2019Photo of TrojanRB3.89/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4TrojanRB, Mar 20, 2019Photo of SveNss0N3.76/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75SveNss0N, Mar 20, 2019Photo of TrisBlair3.61/5  rDev +0.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75TrisBlair, Mar 19, 2019Photo of miguelk3.85/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75miguelk, Mar 19, 2019Photo of McAfee853.63/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75McAfee85, Mar 19, 2019Photo of Wesmaze5/5  rDev +39.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Wesmaze, Mar 18, 2019Photo of ccryder3.9/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75ccryder, Mar 18, 2019Photo of defunksta4.13/5  rDev +15.4%look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Poured from a Look: Pours a beautiful dark brown, almost black color.

Creamy. Goes down like chocolate milk. It is no wonder the Irish picked this as their staple beer.Overall: When you want a light beer and are considering any of American macrolagers, stop yourself and ask yourself rather whether you want a Guinness. This beer incorporates chocolate, roasted grain malts, and even coffee into a drinkable Irish stout that is so smooth, you'll ask yourself why you don't live in Ireland. It defines the light beer version of a stout. So well done and a tradition, you can't go wrong with a Guinness. 953 charactersdefunksta, Mar 18, 2019Photo of Larryfunnell4.18/5  rDev +16.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25I started drinking Guinness in an Irish bed and breakfast, served to me by a lovely Irish lass just after St. Patrick's Day in 1998.

It is not as bitter as I remember, probably due to changing tastes on my part, and has a smooth creamy taste that lingers on the tongue.

'guinness',alcohol,sindoori,"Guinness (/ËˆÉ¡ÉªnÉªs/) is a dark Irish dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness at St. James's Gate, Dublin, Ireland, in 1759. It is one of the most successful beer brands worldwide, brewed in almost 50 countries, and available in over 120. [1][2] Sales in 2011 amounted to 850 million litres (220,000,000 US gal).[1] It is popular with the Irish, both in Ireland and abroad. In spite of declining consumption since 2001,[3] it is still the best-selling alcoholic drink in Ireland.[4][5] where Guinness & Co. Brewery makes almost â‚¬2 billion worth annually.","Date: Gotta love illegible date codes, I think this is a late 2018 can, consumed on 03/28/19.Appearance: Pours out like a coke, then puts on a beautiful cascading act in the glass. Once this is finished, it takes on the traditional stout look with ruby color around the bottom. Guinness produces over two fingers of what has to be the most creamy sand colored head that a beer ever produced.Aroma: Roasted malts, light coffee, and chocolate are all on the nose with the malts actually seeming to have so depth to them. No one aspect is very pronounced, but it smell nice.Taste: Here is where we have some issues. First, Guinness is terribly thin, not a whole lot more substantial than water. The taste, while presenting a pleasant dry roasted bitter malt profile, never really amounts to much else. Yes, there is some chocolate and a mild coffee flavors, but this is a beer seems fearful of being what it should be. The widget in the can does give it a ridiculously creamy texture though. To sum Guinness up, it has been nice to revisit and old staple, but it simply cannot stand up to its craft brethren such as Deschutes Black Butte Porter. This St. Patrick's Day leftover reminds my why I only buy this once a year. 1,233 charactersDoghouseReilly3946, Apr 10, 2019Photo of mvhissom5/5  rDev +39.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5The perfect pint for every occasion.36 charactersmvhissom, Apr 10, 2019Photo of klastinger4.84/5  rDev +35.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75The pinnacle of stouts.23 charactersklastinger, Apr 01, 2019Photo of Daniel4734.5/5  rDev +25.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5It is great, when in drought take a draught.44 charactersDaniel473, Mar 31, 2019Photo of peterpunk153.1/5  rDev -13.4%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3peterpunk15, Mar 30, 2019Photo of StanCobb5/5  rDev +39.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5StanCobb, Mar 30, 2019Photo of LionHeart883/5  rDev -16.2%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3LionHeart88, Mar 29, 2019Photo of Bolli4.15/5  rDev +15.9%look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Bolli, Mar 25, 2019Photo of Beer_Rabbit663.71/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75Beer_Rabbit66, Mar 22, 2019Photo of PhineasMcClintock3.44/5  rDev -3.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5PhineasMcClintock, Mar 21, 2019Photo of M_chav2.09/5  rDev -41.6%look: 3 | smell: 2 | taste: 1.75 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.25M_chav, Mar 21, 2019Photo of MephistosCafe3.57/5  rDev -0.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5MephistosCafe, Mar 20, 2019Photo of TrojanRB3.89/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4TrojanRB, Mar 20, 2019Photo of SveNss0N3.76/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75SveNss0N, Mar 20, 2019Photo of TrisBlair3.61/5  rDev +0.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75TrisBlair, Mar 19, 2019Photo of miguelk3.85/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75miguelk, Mar 19, 2019Photo of McAfee853.63/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75McAfee85, Mar 19, 2019Photo of Wesmaze5/5  rDev +39.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Wesmaze, Mar 18, 2019Photo of ccryder3.9/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75ccryder, Mar 18, 2019Photo of defunksta4.13/5  rDev +15.4%look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Poured from a Look: Pours a beautiful dark brown, almost black color.

'pimm\'s no. 1Â®',alcohol,claire,"Guinness' flavour derives from malted barley and roasted unmalted barley, a relatively modern development, not becoming part of the grist until the mid-20th century. For many years, a portion of aged brew was blended with freshly brewed beer to give a sharp lactic acidflavour. Although Guinness's palate still features a characteristic ""tang"", the company has refused to confirm whether this type of blending still occurs. The draught beer's thick, creamy head comes from mixing the beer with nitrogen and carbon dioxide.[6]",drank while living in england for over 2 years. it is so great; refreshing and a great summer drink!,

'sauvignon blanc',alcohol,claire,"Sauvignon blanc is a green-skinned grape variety that originates from the Bordeaux region of France. The grape most likely gets its name from the French words sauvage (""wild"") and blanc (""white"") due to its early origins as an indigenous grape in South West France.[1] It is possibly a descendant of Savagnin. Sauvignon blanc is planted in many of the world's wine regions, producing a crisp, dry, and refreshing white varietal wine. The grape is also a component of the famous dessert wines from Sauternes and Barsac. Sauvignon blanc is widely cultivated in France, Chile, Romania, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the states of Washington and California in the US. Some New World Sauvignon blancs, particularly from California, may also be called ""FumÃ© Blanc"", a marketing term coined by Robert Mondavi in reference to Pouilly-FumÃ©.Depending on the climate, the flavor can range from aggressively grassy to sweetly tropical. In cooler climates, the grape has a tendency to produce wines with noticeable acidity and ""green flavors"" of grass, green bell peppers and nettles with some tropical fruit (such as passion fruit) and floral (such as elderflower) notes. In warmer climates, it can develop more tropical fruit notes but risk losing a lot of aromatics from over-ripeness, leaving only slight grapefruit and tree fruit (such as peach) notes.[2]Wine experts have used the phrase ""crisp, elegant, and fresh"" as a favorable description of Sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley and New Zealand.[3][4] Sauvignon blanc, when slightly chilled, pairs well with fish or cheese, particularly chÃ¨vre. It is also known as one of the few wines that can pair well with sushi.[5]Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc was one of the first fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in commercial quantities, especially by New Zealand producers. The wine is usually consumed young, as it does not particularly benefit from aging, as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended aging. Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-LÃ©ognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-FumÃ© and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential.[2]The first Friday in May is International Sauvignon Blanc Day.[citation needed]",,
'sherry',alcohol,claire,"Sherry (Spanish: Jerez [xeËˆÉ_eÎ¸]) is a fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the city of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain. Sherry is produced in a variety of styles made primarily from the Palomino grape, ranging from light versions similar to white table wines, such as Manzanilla and Fino, to darker and heavier versions that have been allowed to oxidise as they age in barrel, such as Amontillado and Oloroso. Sweet dessert wines are also made from Pedro Ximenez or Moscatel grapes, and are sometimes blended with Palomino-based Sherries.The word ""Sherry"" is an anglicisation of Xeres (Jerez). Sherry was previously known as sack, from the Spanish saca, meaning ""extraction"" from the solera. In Europe, ""Sherry"" has protected designation of origin status, and under Spanish law, all wine labelled as ""Sherry"" must legally come from the Sherry Triangle, an area in the province of CÃ¡diz between Jerez de la Frontera, SanlÃºcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa MarÃ_a.[1] In 1933 the Jerez DenominaciÃ_n de Origen was the first Spanish denominaciÃ_n to be officially recognised in this way, officially named D.O. Jerez-Xeres-Sherry and sharing the same governing council as D.O. Manzanilla SanlÃºcar de Barrameda.[2]After fermentation is complete, the base wines are fortified with grape spirit in order to increase their final alcohol content.[3] Wines classified as suitable for aging as Fino and Manzanilla are fortified until they reach a total alcohol content of 15.5 per cent by volume. As they age in barrel, they develop a layer of florâ€”a yeast-like growth that helps protect the wine from excessive oxidation. Those wines that are classified to undergo aging as Oloroso are fortified to reach an alcohol content of at least 17 per cent. They do not develop flor and so oxidise slightly as they age, giving them a darker colour. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, port wine is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.Wines from different years are aged and blended using a solera system before bottling, so that bottles of sherry will not usually carry a specific vintage year and can contain a small proportion of very old wine. Sherry is regarded by many wine writers[4] as ""underappreciated""[5] and a ""neglected wine treasure"".[6]",,

When young there are notes of the land: heather, moor, sweet seaweed, and a finish that has a distinctive cracked black pepper hit. Appearance: Brilliant gold. Nose: Powerful peat-smoke with sea-water saltiness, the liquor of fresh oysters, a citrus sweetness.Body: Full.Palate: A rich dried-fruit sweetness with clouds of smoke and strong barley-malt flavours, warming and intense.

'unpeated whiskey',alcohol,claire,"Scotch single malt whisky can be classified into two main flavours: peated (smoky) and unpeated (non-smoky). The smoky aroma in whisky results from the method of drying the malt. If the malt is dried over a peat fire, the components of the peat smoke that have not been completely turned into carbon dioxide and water vapour adhere to the malt. These aromatic compounds are transported through all production steps into the finished whisky.In contrast, the malt for unpeated whisky is dried with hot air without any smoke. The preferences for one of the two production methods are distributed quite asymmetrically among the consumers. A majority of connoisseurs like both peated and unpeated whiskies. Another fraction prefers peated whisky and tolerates unpeated whisky. However, a non-negligible percentage of connoisseurs do not like peated whisky. Therefore different sets of peated, unpeated and mixed whisky samples were offered to the participants, thus making sure that each participant received the type of whisky they liked best.This approach made sure that no whiskies were rated poorly due to individual preferences or dislikes. Perhaps this approach is also the reason why the mean value of the quality ratings (3.3 to 3.5 points) was 0.3 to 0.5 scale points (7.5% to 12.5%) above the middle of the scale (3.0). Perhaps the reason for these ratings above the mean value was that the participants liked the samples a bit more than the average of the whiskies they know.

Traditionally, raspberries were a midsummer crop, but with new technology, cultivars, and transportation, they can now be obtained year-round. Raspberries need ample sun and water for optimal development. Raspberries thrive in well-drained soil with a pH between 6 and 7 with ample organic matter to assist in retaining water.[15] While moisture is essential, wet and heavy soils or excess irrigation can bring on Phytophthora root rot, which is one of the most serious pest problems facing the red raspberry.

Almonds are available in many forms, such as whole, sliced (flaked, slivered), and as flour. Almond pieces around 2â€“3 mm in size, called ""nibs"", are used for special purposes such as decoration.[42] Almonds yield almond oil and can also be made into almond butter or almond milk. These products can be used in both sweet and savoury dishes.Along with other nuts, almonds can be sprinkled over breakfasts and desserts, particularly muesli or ice cream-based dishes. Almonds are used in marzipan, nougat, many pastries (including jesuites), cookies (including French macarons, macaroons), and cakes (including financiers), noghl, and other sweets and desserts. They are also used to make almond butter, a spread similar to peanut butter, popular with peanut allergy sufferers and for its naturally sweeter taste. The young, developing fruit of the almond tree can be eaten whole (green almonds) when they are still green and fleshy on the outside and the inner shell has not yet hardened. The fruit is somewhat sour, but is a popular snack in parts of the Middle East, eaten dipped in salt to balance the sour taste. Also in the Middle East they are often eaten with dates. They are available only from mid-April to mid-June in the Northern Hemisphere; pickling or brining extends the fruit's shelf life.Almond cookies, Chinese almond biscuits, and Italian ricciarelli are made with almonds.In Greece, ground blanched almonds are used as the base material in a great variety of desserts, usually called amygdalota (Î±Î_Ï…Î_Î´Î±Î»Ï‰Ï„Î¬). Because of their white color, most are traditionally considered wedding sweets and are served at wedding banquets. In addition, a soft drink known as soumada is made from almonds in various regions.In Hejaz, a region of Saudi Arabia, ground almonds are used by adding them with cold milk to a hot coffee cup in addition to cinnamon powder and corn starch to make Almond Coffee Gahwat Al-lÅçz (Ù‚Ù‡ÙˆØ© Ø§Ù„Ù„ÙˆØ_).In Iran, green almonds are dipped in sea salt and eaten as snacks on street markets; they are called chaqale bÃ¢dam. Also sweet almonds are used to prepare a special food for babies, named harire badam. Almonds are added to some foods, cookies, and desserts, or are used to decorate foods. People in Iran consume roasted nuts for special events, for example, during New Year (Nowruz) parties.In Italy, bitter almonds are the traditional base for amaretti[43][44] (almond macaroons), a common dessert. Traditionally, a low percentage of bitter almonds (10â€“20%) is added to the ingredients, which gives the cookies their bitter taste (commercially, apricot kernels are used as a substitute for bitter almonds). Almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in torrone. In Apulia and Sicily, pasta di mandorle (almond paste) is used to make small soft cakes, often decorated with jam, pistachio, or chocolate. In Sicily, almond milk is a popular refreshing beverage in summer.In Morocco, almonds in the form of sweet almond paste are the main ingredient in pastry fillings, and several other desserts. Fried blanched whole almonds are also used to decorate sweet tajines such as lamb with prunes. A drink made from almonds mixed with milk is served in important ceremonies such as weddings and can also be ordered in some cafes. Southwestern Berber regions of Essaouira and Souss are also known for amlou, a spread made of almond paste, argan oil, and honey. Almond paste is also mixed with toasted flour and among others, honey, olive oil or butter, anise, fennel, sesame seeds, and cinnamon to make sellou (also called zamita in Meknes or slilou in Marrakech), a sweet snack known for its long shelf life and high nutritive value.In Indian cuisine, almonds are the base ingredients of pasanda-style and Mughlai curries. Badam halva is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as sohan barfi), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface. Almonds form the base of various drinks which are supposed to have cooling properties. Almond sherbet or sherbet-e-badaam, is a popular summer drink. Almonds are also sold as a snack with added salt.In Israel almonds are topping tahini cookie or eaten as a snack.The 'Marcona' almond cultivar is recognizably different from other almonds and is marketed by name.[45] The kernel is short, round, relatively sweet, and delicate in texture. Its origin is unknown and has been grown in Spain for a long time; the tree is very productive, and the shell of the nut is very hard.[45] 'Marcona' almonds are traditionally served after being lightly fried in oil, and are used by Spanish confectioners to prepare a sweet called turrÃ_n.Certain natural food stores sell ""bitter almonds"" or ""apricot kernels"" labeled as such, requiring significant caution by consumers for how to prepare and eat these products.",,

Lavender flowers are occasionally blended with black, green, or herbal teas. Lavender flavours baked goods and desserts, pairing especially well with chocolate. In the United States, both lavender syrup and dried lavender buds are used to make lavender scones and marshmallows.[28][29]Lavender buds are put into sugar for two weeks to allow the essential oils and fragrance to transfer; then the sugar itself is used in baking. Lavender can be used in breads where recipes call for rosemary. Lavender can be used decoratively in dishes or spirits, or as a decorative and aromatic in a glass of champagne. Lavender is used in savory dishes, giving stews and reduced sauces aromatic flair. It is also used to scent flans, custards, and sorbets",,

Many other hybrids, as well as numerous cultivars, are known.The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution across Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and North America.[6]Mints are aromatic, almost exclusively perennial herbs. They have wide-spreading underground and overground stolons[7] and erect, square,[8] branched stems. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, from oblong to lanceolate, often downy, and with a serrated margin. Leaf colors range from dark green and gray-green to purple, blue, and sometimes pale yellow.[6] The flowers are white to purple and produced in false whorls called verticillasters. The corolla is two-lipped with four subequal lobes, the upper lobe usually the largest. The fruit is a nutlet, containing one to four seeds.While the species that makes up the genus Mentha is widely distributed and can be found in many environments, most grow best in wet environments and moist soils.

It belongs to the genus Prunus which includes the cherry, apricot, almond and plum, in the rose family. The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated seed shell. Due to their close relatedness, the inside of a peach stone tastes remarkably similar to almond, and peach stones are often used to make a cheap version of marzipan, known as persipan.[4]Peaches and nectarines are the same species, even though they are regarded commercially as different fruits. In contrast to peaches, whose fruits present the characteristic fuzz on the skin, nectarines are characterized by the absence of fruit-skin trichomes (fuzz-less fruit); it is thought that a mutation in a single gene (MYB25) is responsible for the hair or no-hair difference between the two.[5][6]China alone produced 58% of the world's total for peaches and nectarines in 2016.[7]",,

bar spoon turmeric,mixer,lauren,"Turmeric (Curcuma longa; /ˈtɜːrmərɪk/ or variously /ˈtjuːmərɪk/[2]) is a flowering plant of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, the roots of which are used in cooking.[3] The plant is rhizomatous, herbaceous, and perennial, and is native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, and requires temperatures between 20 and 30 °C (68 and 86 °F) and a considerable amount of annual rainfall to thrive. Plants are gathered each year for their rhizomes, some for propagation in the following season and some for consumption. When not used fresh, the rhizomes are boiled in water for about 30–45 minutes and then dried in hot ovens, after which they are ground into a deep orange-yellow powder commonly used as a coloring and flavoring agent in many Asian cuisines, especially for curries, as well as for dyeing.[4] Turmeric powder has a warm, bitter, black pepper-like flavor and earthy, mustard-like aroma.[5][6]",,

almond syrup,mixer,lauren,"Historically, almond syrup was an emulsion of sweet and bitter almonds, usually made with barley syrup (orgeat syrup) or in a syrup of orange flower water and sugar, often flavored with a synthetic aroma of almonds.[40] Orgeat syrup is an important ingredient in the Mai Tai and many other Tiki drinks.[50][51][52] Due to the cyanide found in bitter almonds, modern syrups generally are produced only from sweet almonds. Such syrup products do not contain significant levels of hydrocyanic acid, so are generally considered safe for human consumption.",,
apple cider,mixer,lauren,"Apple cider (also called sweet cider or soft cider or simply cider) is the name used in the United States and parts of Canada for an unfiltered, unsweetened, non-alcoholic beverage made from apples. Though typically referred to simply as ""cider"" in those areas, it is not to be confused with the alcoholic beverage known as cider throughout most of the world, called hard cider in the US. It is the liquid extracted from an apple and all its components, that is then boiled to concentration. The liquid can be extracted from the apple itself, the apple core, the trimmings from apples, or apple culls. Once pressed mainly at farmsteads and local mills, apple cider is easy and inexpensive to make.[1] It is typically opaque due to fine apple particles in suspension and generally tangier than commercial filtered apple juice, but this depends on the variety of apples used.[2] Cider is typically pasteurized to kill bacteria and extend its shelf life, but untreated cider is common. In either form, apple cider is seasonally produced in autumn.[3] It is traditionally served on the Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and various New Year's Eve holidays, sometimes heated and mulled.",,
apple juice,mixer,lauren,"Apple juice is a fruit juice made by the maceration and pressing of an apple. The resulting expelled juice may be further treated by enzymatic and centrifugal clarification to remove the starch and pectin, which holds fine particulate in suspension, and then pasteurized for packaging in glass, metal or aseptic processing system containers, or further treated by dehydration processes to a concentrate. Due to the complex and costly equipment required to extract and clarify juice from apples in large volume, apple juice is normally produced commercially. In the United States, unfiltered fresh apple juice is made by smaller operations in areas of high apple production, in the form of unclarified apple cider. Apple juice is one of the most common fruit juices in the world, with world production led by China, Poland, the United States, and Germany",,
apple purée,mixer,lauren,"Apples are first selected based on ripeness, texture, natural sweetness and tartness/acidity. Some of these apples are pressed into fresh apple cider, while the rest are peeled and cored, then wholly steamed and cooked into apple puree.

Small amounts of sodium bicarbonate are added to the mixture in order to reduce acidity and help bring out sweetness from the natural fructose available in the apples.",,
apricot & cardamom syrup,mixer,lauren,"These fragrant cardamom flavored apricots are so useful, I make big batches of them to give as gifts and to use for my own entertaining. They are delicious with drained whole milk yogurt, ice cream or creme fraiche make an excellent filling for tarts and turnovers, or accompaniment to plain cakes, with some whipped cream. They are also spectacular roasted and served with crème fraiche (see recipe). I like to use California apricots because they have more intense flavor and delicate texture than Turkish ones.",,
apricot jam,mixer,lauren,"This recipe yields a very chunky, rustic jam that relies entirely on the fruit's natural pectin, in concert with sugar, lemon juice, and heat, to set perfectly. This jam works well with Blenheim apricots, or any other small, freestone apricot (apricots that have pits that pop out easily, rather than clinging to the flesh). If you have particularly firm or large apricots, or you would just like a jam with a more refined texture, feel free to macerate the apricot halves in the sugar at room temperature overnight before proceeding with the recipe.",,
apricot nectar,mixer,lauren,"homemade apricot nectar. Since trying it for the first time, I knew that majority of my apricots will end up being pushed through the sieve. So delicious! And so many different uses! Especially in those fizzy Bellinis 😉 Perhaps, if Bellini  is not your thing, you can mix it with some ginger ale or lemonade/ lime soda. It is also delicious over the ice on it’s own, or simply mixed with some water. It's like juice but a little more dense and the flavor is more intense. Nectars are a type of non-carbonated soft drink made by muddling[citation needed] the flesh of fruits.",,
bacon lardons,mixer,lauren,"A lardon, also called lardoon or larding, is a small strip or cube of fatty bacon, or pork fat (usually subcutaneous fat) used in a wide variety of cuisines to flavor savory foods and salads. In French cuisine, lardons are also used for larding, by threading them with a needle into meats that are to be braised or roasted. Lardons are not normally smoked, and they are made from pork that has been cured with salt. The Oxford English Dictionary defines ""lardon"" as ""one of the pieces of bacon or pork which are inserted in meat in the process of larding"", giving primacy to that process.[1] According to the Middle English Dictionary, the earliest occurrence of the word is in 1381, in the work Pegge Cook; it advises to insert lardons in cranes and herons.[2]",,

black pepper,mixer,lauren,"Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, cultivated for its fruit, known as a peppercorn, which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning. When fresh and fully mature, it is about 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter and dark red, and contains a single seed, like all drupes. Peppercorns and the ground pepper derived from them may be described simply as pepper, or more precisely as black pepper (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green pepper (dried unripe fruit), or white pepper (ripe fruit seeds). Ground dried and cooked peppercorns have been used since antiquity, both for flavour and as a traditional medicine. Black pepper is the world's most traded spice, and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world. Its spiciness is due to the chemical compound piperine, which is a different kind of spicy from the capsaicin characteristic of chili peppers. It is ubiquitous in the modern world as a seasoning, and is often paired with salt and available on dining tables in shakers.",,
boiling water,mixer,lauren,"Boiling is the rapid vaporization of a liquid, which occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding atmosphere. There are two main types of boiling: nucleate boiling where small bubbles of vapour form at discrete points, and critical heat flux boiling where the boiling surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and a film of vapor forms on the surface. Transition boiling is an intermediate, unstable form of boiling with elements of both types. The boiling point of water is 100 °C or 212 °F but is lower with the decreased atmospheric pressure found at higher altitudes. Boiling is also used in cooking. Foods suitable for boiling include vegetables, starchy foods such as rice, noodles and potatoes, eggs, meats, sauces, stocks, and soups. As a cooking method, it is simple and suitable for large-scale cookery. Tough meats or poultry can be given a long, slow cooking and a nutritious stock is produced. Disadvantages include loss of water-soluble vitamins and minerals. Commercially prepared foodstuffs are sometimes packed in polythene sachets and sold as ""boil-in-the-bag"" products.",,
brown sugar,mixer,lauren,"Brown sugar is a sucrose sugar product with a distinctive brown color due to the presence of molasses. It is either an unrefined or partially refined soft sugar consisting of sugar crystals with some residual molasses content (natural brown sugar), or it is produced by the addition of molasses to refined white sugar (commercial brown sugar). The Codex Alimentarius requires brown sugar to contain at least 88% of sucrose plus invert sugar.[1] Commercial brown sugar contains from 3.5% molasses (light brown sugar) to 6.5% molasses (dark brown sugar) based on total volume.[2] Based on total weight, regular commercial brown sugar contains up to 10% molasses.[3] The product is naturally moist from the hygroscopic nature of the molasses and is often labelled as ""soft."" The product may undergo processing to give a product that flows better for industrial handling. The addition of dyes or other chemicals may be permitted in some areas or for industrial products.",,
"butter, melted",mixer,lauren,"Butter (/ˈbʌtə/) is a dairy product with high butterfat content which is solid when chilled and at room temperature in some regions, and liquid when warmed. It is made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk to separate the butterfat from the buttermilk. It is generally used as a spread on plain or toasted bread products and a condiment on cooked vegetables, as well as in cooking, such as baking, sauce making, and pan frying. Butter consists of butterfat, milk proteins and water, and often added salt. Most frequently made from cow's milk, butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks. Salt (such as dairy salt), flavorings (such as garlic) and preservatives are sometimes added to butter. Rendering butter, removing the water and milk solids, produces clarified butter or ghee, which is almost entirely butterfat. Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream, where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers. Butter remains a firm solid when refrigerated, but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature, and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32 to 35 °C (90 to 95 °F). The density of butter is 911 grams per Litre (0.950 lb per US pint).[1] It generally has a pale yellow color, but varies from deep yellow to nearly white. Its natural, unmodified color is dependent on the source animal's feed and genetics, but the commercial manufacturing process commonly manipulates the color with food colorings like annatto[2] or carotene.",,

cream of coconut,mixer,ian,"Cream of coconut is a thick, heavily sweetened processed coconut milk product resembling condensed milk.[33] It is originally produced by the Puerto Rican company Coco López and is used most notably in piña coladas in the United States. It can also be used for other cocktail drinks and various desserts. It should not be confused with or used as a substitute for coconut cream",,
cream,mixer,ian,"Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-butterfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called ""separators"". In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat.[1][2]",,
cola,mixer,ian,"Cola is a sweetened, carbonated soft drink flavored with vanilla, cinnamon, citrus oils and other flavorings. Most contain caffeine, which was originally sourced from the kola nut, leading to the drink's name, though other sources are now also used. Cola became popular worldwide after pharmacist John Pemberton invented Coca-Cola in 1886.[3][4] His non-alcoholic recipe was inspired by the coca wine of pharmacist Angelo Mariani, created in 1863.[4]",,
cracked black pepper,mixer,ian,"Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, cultivated for its fruit, known as a peppercorn, which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning. When fresh and fully mature, it is about 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter and dark red, and contains a single seed, like all drupes. Peppercorns and the ground pepper derived from them may be described simply as pepper, or more precisely as black pepper (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green pepper (dried unripe fruit), or white pepper (ripe fruit seeds). Ground dried and cooked peppercorns have been used since antiquity, both for flavour and as a traditional medicine. Black pepper is the world's most traded spice, and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world. Its spiciness is due to the chemical compound piperine, which is a different kind of spicy from the capsaicin characteristic of chili peppers. It is ubiquitous in the modern world as a seasoning, and is often paired with salt and available on dining tables in shakers.",,
cucumber water,mixer,ian,"Cucumber water is a cheap, quick, and flavorful way to drink and enjoy water.

cup of filter coffee,mixer,ian,"Brewed coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, then allowing to brew. There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press.

diet tonic water,mixer,ian,"tonic is both carbonated and contains added minerals. But you'd never mistake the taste of tonic for any of the others. The biggest difference with tonic water is that it contains quinine, a compound isolated from the bark of cinchona trees. The compound was added to water centuries ago to prevent malaria. Because quinine is so bitter, someone along the way added sugar and carbonation to help the drink go down a little easier. Ta-da! That's the gin-friendly tonic water we have today. It's the only drink on this list that contains calories, mostly from the sugar.",,
distilled vinegar,mixer,ian,"The term ""distilled vinegar"" as used in the United States (called ""spirit vinegar"" in the UK, ""white vinegar"" in Canada[27]) is something of a misnomer because it is not produced by distillation but by fermentation of distilled alcohol. The fermentate is diluted to produce a colorless solution of 5% to 8% acetic acid in water, with a pH of about 2.6. This is variously known as distilled spirit, ""virgin"" vinegar,[28] or white vinegar, and is used in cooking, baking, meat preservation, and pickling, as well as for medicinal, laboratory, and cleaning purposes.[26] The most common starting material in some regions, because of its low cost, is malt,[29] or in the United States, corn. It is sometimes derived from petroleum.[30] Distilled vinegar is used predominantly for cooking, although in Scotland it is used as an alternative to brown or light malt vinegar. White distilled vinegar can also be used for cleaning, and some is actually sold specifically for this purpose.",,
dark chocolate,mixer,ian,"Dark chocolate (also known as black chocolate, plain chocolate, or sour chocolate) is a form of chocolate containing cocoa solids, cocoa butter and sugar, without the milk found in milk chocolate.[1] Government and industry standards of what products may be labeled ""dark chocolate"" vary by country and market.[1]",,
demerara sugar syrup,mixer,ian,"While standard simple syrup made with everyday white sugar works for most cocktails, some drinks call for demerara simple syrup made with amber-hued demerara sugar. This type of cane sugar is more like brown sugar than white sugar, in both look and flavor. Combined with water, it dissolves into a richly flavored syrup that can stand up to strong spirits and other powerful cocktail ingredients. Try swapping it in for your usual simple syrup or straight sugar in an Old Fashioned for an extra cozy cocktail or use it in tiki cocktails like Grog. It will also take your Daiquiri over the top, elevating the flavors in the rum and enriching the fresh lime juice. Demerara syrup is also absolutely necessary for a sweet and creamy Rum Flip. And it helps make a better Rum Punch.",,
demerara sugar,mixer,ian,"Demerara sugar is a large-grained, somewhat crunchy, raw sugar with origins in Guyana (a colony formerly called Demerara).

egg yolk,mixer,ian,"As stored food, yolks are often rich in vitamins, minerals, lipids and proteins. The proteins function partly as food in their own right, and partly in controlling the storage and supply of the other nutrients. For example, in some species the amount of yolk in an egg cell affects the developmental processes that follow fertilization. The yolk is not living cell material like protoplasm, but largely passive material, that is to say deutoplasm. The food material and associated control structures are supplied during oogenesis. Some of the material is stored more or less in the form in which the maternal body supplied it, partly as processed by dedicated non-germ tissues in the egg, while part of the biosynthetic processing into its final form happens in the oocyte itself.[1]",,

Lime pickles are an integral part of Indian cuisine. South Indian cuisine is heavily based on lime; having either lemon pickle or lime pickle is considered an essential of Onam Sadhya.

In cooking, lime is valued both for the acidity of its juice and the floral aroma of its zest. It is a common ingredient in authentic Mexican, Vietnamese and Thai dishes. Lime soup is a traditional dish from the Mexican state of Yucatan. It is also used for its pickling properties in ceviche. Some guacamole recipes call for lime juice.

The use of dried limes (called black lime or loomi) as a flavouring is typical of Persian cuisine and Iraqi cuisine, as well as in Persian Gulf-style baharat (a spice mixture that is also called kabsa or kebsa).

Lime is an ingredient of many cuisines from India, and many varieties of pickles are made, e.g. sweetened lime pickle, salted pickle, and lime chutney.

Key lime gives the character flavoring to the American dessert known as Key lime pie. In Australia, desert lime is used for making marmalade.

Lime is an ingredient in several highball cocktails, often based on gin, such as gin and tonic, the gimlet and the Rickey. Freshly squeezed lime juice is also considered a key ingredient in margaritas, although sometimes lemon juice is substituted.

Botanical features
The clove tree is an evergreen that grows up to 8–12 m tall, with large leaves and crimson flowers grouped in terminal clusters. The flower buds initially have a pale hue, gradually turn green, then transition to a bright red when ready for harvest. Cloves are harvested at 1.5–2.0 cm long, and consist of a long calyx that terminates in four spreading sepals, and four unopened petals that form a small central ball.

Uses

Dried cloves

Clove tree flowers
Cloves are used in the cuisine of Asian, African, and the Near and Middle East countries, lending flavor to meats, curries, and marinades, as well as fruit such as apples, pears or rhubarb. Cloves may be used to give aromatic and flavor qualities to hot beverages, often combined with other ingredients such as lemon and sugar. They are a common element in spice blends such as pumpkin pie spice and speculoos spices.

In Mexican cuisine, cloves are best known as clavos de olor, and often accompany cumin and cinnamon.[3] They are also used in Peruvian cuisine, in a wide variety of dishes as carapulcra and arroz con leche.

A major component of clove taste is imparted by the chemical eugenol,[4] and the quantity of the spice required is typically small. It pairs well with cinnamon, allspice, vanilla, red wine and basil, as well as onion, citrus peel, star anise, or peppercorns.

Non-culinary uses
The spice is used in a type of cigarette called kretek in Indonesia.[1] Clove cigarettes have been smoked throughout Europe, Asia and the United States. Starting in 2009, clove cigarettes must be classified as cigars in the US.[5]

Because of the bioactive chemicals of clove, the spice may be used as an ant repellent.[6]

Cloves can be used to make a fragrance pomander when combined with an orange. When given as a gift in Victorian England, such a pomander indicated warmth of feeling.

Though long-used in traditional medicine, there is little evidence that clove oil containing eugenol is effective for toothache pain or other types of pain,[7][8] although one review reported efficacy of eugenol combined with zinc oxide as an analgesic for alveolar osteitis.[9] Studies to determine its effectiveness for fever reduction, as a mosquito repellent, and to prevent premature ejaculation have been inconclusive.[7][8] It remains unproven whether using cloves or clove oil reduces blood sugar levels.[8] Use of clove for any medicinal purpose has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and its use may cause adverse effects if taken orally by people with liver disease, blood clotting and immune system disorders, or food allergies.[7]",,

hot chocolate,mixer,sindoori,"Hot chocolate, also known as drinking chocolate, cocoa, and as chocolate tea in Nigeria, is a heated drink consisting of shaved chocolate, melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream or marshmallows. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.[1]

The first chocolate drink is believed to have been created by the Mayans around 2,500-3,000 years ago, and a cocoa drink was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD, by which they referred to as xocōlātl.[2][3] The drink became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the New World and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was even used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.

Hot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced chocolate para mesa of Latin America, the very thick cioccolata calda served in Italy and chocolate a la taza served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. Prepared hot chocolate can be purchased from a range of establishments, including cafeterias, fast food restaurants, coffeehouses and teahouses. Powdered hot chocolate mixes, which can be added to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at grocery stores and online.",,

hot milk,mixer,sindoori,"Flavored milk is a sweetened dairy drink made with milk, sugar, food colorings and artificial or natural flavorings. Flavored milk is often pasteurized using ultra-high-temperature (UHT) treatment, which gives it a longer shelf-life than plain milk.

honey,mixer,sindoori,"Honey is a sweet, viscous food substance produced by bees and some related insects.[1] Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants (floral nectar) or from secretions of other insects (such as honeydew), by regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. Bees store honey in wax structures called a honeycomb.[1][2] The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus Apis) is the best-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption.[3] Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from hives of domesticated bees, a practice known as beekeeping or apiculture.

Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose (granulated sugar).[4][5] It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener.[4] Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years.[6][7]

Honey provides 46 calories in a serving of one tablespoon (15 ml).[8] Honey is regarded as safe when not taken in excessive amounts.[9]

Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity. Several cave paintings in Cuevas de la Araña, Spain, depict humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago.[10][11]",,
horseradish,mixer,sindoori,"Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana, syn. Cochlearia armoracia) is a perennial plant of the family Brassicaceae (which also includes mustard, wasabi, broccoli, and cabbage). It is a root vegetable used as a spice and prepared as a condiment.

The plant is probably native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is popular worldwide. It grows up to 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) tall, and is cultivated primarily for its large, white, tapered root.[2][3][4][5]

The intact horseradish root has hardly any aroma. When cut or grated enzymes from the now-broken plant cells break down sinigrin (a glucosinolate) to produce allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil), which irritates the mucous membranes of the sinuses and eyes. Grated mash should be used immediately or preserved in vinegar for best flavor. Once exposed to air or heat it will begin to lose its pungency, darken in color, and become unpleasantly bitter tasting over time.The distinctive pungent taste of horseradish is from the compound allyl isothiocyanate. Upon crushing the flesh of horseradish, the enzyme myrosinase is released and acts on the glucosinolates sinigrin and gluconasturtiin, which are precursors to the allyl isothiocyanate. The allyl isothiocyanate serves the plant as a natural defense against herbivores. Since allyl isothiocyanate is harmful to the plant itself, it is stored in the harmless form of the glucosinolate, separate from the myrosinase enzyme. When an animal chews the plant, the allyl isothiocyanate is released, repelling the animal.[17] Allyl isothiocyanate is an unstable compound, degrading over the course of days at 37 °C (99 °F).[18] Because of this instability, horseradish sauces lack the pungency of the freshly crushed roots.

Cooks use the terms ""horseradish"" or ""prepared horseradish"" to refer to the grated root of the horseradish plant mixed with vinegar. Prepared horseradish is white to creamy-beige in color. It can be stored for months under refrigeration, but eventually will darken, indicating it is losing flavour and should be replaced. The leaves of the plant, while edible, are not commonly eaten, and are referred to as ""horseradish greens"", which have a flavor similar to that of the roots.",,

ice cream,mixer,sindoori,"Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice)[1] is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from dairy milk or cream, or soy, cashew, coconut or almondmilk, and is flavored with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice, such as cocoa or vanilla. Colourings are usually added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.

The meaning of the name ""ice cream"" varies from one country to another. Terms such as ""frozen custard,"" ""frozen yogurt,"" ""sorbet,"" ""gelato,"" and others are used to distinguish different varieties and styles. In some countries, such as the United States, ""ice cream"" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream.[2] Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled ""frozen dessert"" instead.[3] In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.

Ice cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible cones. Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and even baked items, such as Baked Alaska.",,
iced tea,mixer,sindoori,"Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub (bush) native to East Asia.[3] After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.[4] There are many different types of tea; some, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,[5] while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral or grassy notes.

Tea originated in Southwest China during the Shang dynasty, where it was used as a medicinal drink.[6] An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the 3rd century AD, in a medical text written by Hua Tuo.[7] It was popularized as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century.[8] During the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among Britons, who started large-scale production and commercialization of the plant in India. Combined, China and India supplied 62% of the world's tea in 2016.

The term herbal tea refers to drinks not made from Camellia sinensis: infusions of fruit, leaves, or other parts of the plant, such as steeps of rosehip, chamomile, or rooibos. These are sometimes[9] called tisanes or herbal infusions to prevent confusion with tea made from the tea plant.",,
infused with chilli,mixer,sindoori,"The chili pepper (also chile, chile pepper, chilli pepper, or chilli[2]), from Nahuatl chīlli (Nahuatl pronunciation: [ˈt͡ʃiːli] (About this soundlisten)), is the fruit of plants from the genus Capsicum which are members of the nightshade family, Solanaceae.[3] Chili peppers are widely used in many cuisines as a spice to add heat to dishes. The substances that give chili peppers their intensity when ingested or applied topically are capsaicin and related compounds known as capsaicinoids.

Chili peppers originated in Mexico.[4] After the Columbian Exchange, many cultivars of chili pepper spread across the world, used for both food and traditional medicine.

Cultivars grown in North America and Europe are believed to all derive from Capsicum annuum, and have white, yellow, red or purple to black fruits. In 2016, world production of raw green chili peppers was 34.5 million tonnes, with China producing half of the world total",,
jasmine tea,mixer,sindoori,"Jasmine tea (Chinese: 茉莉花茶; pinyin: mòlìhuā chá) is tea scented with the aroma of jasmine blossoms. Typically, jasmine tea has green tea as the tea base; however, white tea and black tea are also used. The resulting flavour of jasmine tea is subtly sweet and highly fragrant. It is the most famous scented tea in China.[1]

The jasmine plant is believed to have been introduced into China from eastern South Asia via India during the Han Dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD),[2] and was being used to scent tea around the fifth century.[2] However, jasmine tea did not become widespread until the Qing Dynasty (1644 to 1912 AD), when tea started to be exported in large quantities to the West. Nowadays, it's still a common drink served in tea shops around the world.

The jasmine plant is grown at high elevations in the mountains. Jasmine tea produced in the Chinese province of Fujian has the best reputation.[1] Jasmine tea is also produced in the provinces of Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Zhejiang.[1] Japan is also known for the production of jasmine tea, especially in Okinawa Prefecture, where it is called Sanpin-cha (さんぴん茶).

Modern biological studies have shown that drinking jasmine tea can have health and immunity benefits. Jasmine tea contains several different kinds of antioxidants that provide protection to the membranes of red blood cells; this added protection helps fend off free radical-induced oxidation of the red blood cells.[3]

Preparation
Tea leaves are harvested in the early spring and stored until the late summer when fresh jasmine flowers are in bloom. Jasmine flowers are picked early in the day when the small petals are tightly closed. The flowers are kept cool until nightfall. During the night, jasmine flowers open, releasing their fragrance. This is when the tea scenting takes place. There are two main methods used to scent the tea with the jasmine.[4] In one method the tea and flowers are placed in alternating layers;[5] in the other, the tea is blended with jasmine flowers and stored overnight.[2] It takes over four hours for the tea to absorb the fragrance and flavour of the jasmine blossoms. The scenting process may be repeated as many as six or seven times for top grades such as Yin Hao.[2] The tea absorbs moisture from the fresh Jasmine flowers so it must be dried again to prevent spoilage.

Cultural uses
In northern China it is customary to serve Jasmine tea as a welcoming gesture to guests.[1] Jasmine tea is the local tea beverage of Fuzhou, while jasmine flowers are the municipal flower of that city.

Jasmine has symbolic meanings in the Chinese culture. This flower is not only the symbol of forever love but also one of the holy flowers of Buddhism. For example, the crown of the Buddhist in the Ajanta wall paintings, a world heritage site, is decorated by golden jasmine flowers. The fragrance of jasmines is thought to be of heaven. In the past, people in Fuzhou considered tea as an antidote to a lot of poisons. In the Fuzhou dialect, the word for buying medicine literally means buying tea; brewing medicine, brewing tea; taking medicine, drinking tea. In addition, tea culture is important by shaping the art of drinking tea which follows different steps.[6]

Fuzhou Jasmine Tea
Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian, is the most important city in producing jasmine tea in China.[7] The city is built at a river basin and surrounded by mountains. The climate in Fuzhou is mild, rainfall is abundant and the day-night temperature difference is obvious, creating favorable conditions for jasmine flowers to grow. And there is also the microclimate needed for tea trees -- jasmines are planted near rivers, while tea trees grow on slopes 600 to 1,000 meters above the sea level.[8] Fuzhou has 1,200 hectares of tea gardens and last year it produced 110,000 tons of jasmine tea, worth 1.78 billion yuan ($290 million).[9]

After the jasmine plant was introduced into Fuzhou, people planted the flower broadly. During 1368-1644, the Northern Song Dynasty, Fuzhou gained the name of ""The City of Jasmine in China"". Fuzhou is regarded as the origin of the jasmine tea production process, and so far it is the only city to contain the complete production process. The jasmine tea making process started from the Tang Dynasty and had a great change in the Ming Dynasty. Before 1937, the development of Fuzhou Jasmine tea was fast and products were sold to many regions. Because of the war, the output dropped quickly. During 1950s-1990s the industry revived and reached 60% of the total national production, but after that, it fell again.

The government is still working on reviving Fuzhou jasmine tea. In recent years, the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and government strove to protect and develop the system of Fuzhou jasmine planting and tea culture, and took active measures to cultivate good stock and applied for the heritage list.[10]

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations awarded the ""Fuzhou jasmine tea and tea culture system"" as one of the ""Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems"". [11] Experts from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations specially went to Fuzhou to inspect the Fuzhou Jasmine Planting and Tea Culture System on April 5. After the visit, it was awarded the “Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System” title in Rome, Italy, on April 29, 2014.

Lime pickles are an integral part of Indian cuisine. South Indian cuisine is heavily based on lime; having either lemon pickle or lime pickle is considered an essential of Onam Sadhya.

In cooking, lime is valued both for the acidity of its juice and the floral aroma of its zest. It is a common ingredient in authentic Mexican, Vietnamese and Thai dishes. Lime soup is a traditional dish from the Mexican state of Yucatan. It is also used for its pickling properties in ceviche. Some guacamole recipes call for lime juice.

The use of dried limes (called black lime or loomi) as a flavouring is typical of Persian cuisine and Iraqi cuisine, as well as in Persian Gulf-style baharat (a spice mixture that is also called kabsa or kebsa).

Lime is an ingredient of many cuisines from India, and many varieties of pickles are made, e.g. sweetened lime pickle, salted pickle, and lime chutney.

Key lime gives the character flavoring to the American dessert known as Key lime pie. In Australia, desert lime is used for making marmalade.

Lime is an ingredient in several highball cocktails, often based on gin, such as gin and tonic, the gimlet and the Rickey. Freshly squeezed lime juice is also considered a key ingredient in margaritas, although sometimes lemon juice is substituted.

Maple syrup is generally low in overall micronutrient content, although manganese and riboflavin are at high levels along with moderate amounts of zinc and calcium (right table). It also contains trace amounts of amino acids which increase in content as sap flow occurs.[72] Maple syrup contains a wide variety of volatile organic compounds, including vanillin, hydroxybutanone, and propionaldehyde. It is not yet known exactly what compounds are responsible for maple syrup's distinctive flavour,[33] however its primary flavour contributing compounds are maple furanone, strawberry furanone, and maltol.[73] New compounds have been identified in maple syrup, one of which is quebecol, a natural phenolic compound created when the maple sap is boiled to create syrup.[74] One author described maple syrup as ""a unique ingredient, smooth- and silky-textured, with a sweet, distinctive flavour – hints of caramel with overtones of toffee will not do – and a rare colour, amber set alight. Maple flavour is, well, maple flavour, uniquely different from any other.""[45] Agriculture Canada has developed a ""flavour wheel"" that details 91 unique flavours that can be present in maple syrup. These flavours are divided into 13 families: vanilla, empyreumatic (burnt), milky, fruity, floral, spicy, foreign (deterioration or fermentation), foreign (environment), maple, confectionery, plant (herbaceous), plant (forest, humus or cereals), and plant (ligneous).[75][76] These flavours are evaluated using a procedure similar to wine tasting.[77] Other culinary experts praise its unique flavour.[78][79][80][81] Maple syrup and its various artificial imitations are widely used as toppings for pancakes, waffles, and French toast in North America. They can also be used to flavour a variety of foods, including fritters, ice cream, hot cereal, fresh fruit, and sausages.

For many decades now, the preferred citrus fruit for marmalade production in the British Isles has been the Spanish Seville orange, Citrus aurantium var. aurantium, prized for its high pectin content, which sets readily to the thick consistency expected of marmalade. The peel imparts a bitter taste. The term ""marmalade"" is a translation of the Portuguese marmelada that originated from the word marmelo (English: quince) .

mint liqueur,mixer,shirley,"Crème de menthe (pronounced [kʁɛm də mɑ̃t], French for ""mint cream"") is a sweet, mint-flavored alcoholic beverage.

orange extract,mixer,shirley,"This is a very balanced, lightly nuanced flavor that adds so much to culinary creations. We've used this brand before and we will again in the future.

This extract packs a burst of flavor, start with just a little! The product comes attractively boxed with the 4oz size, also a note with a list of tips and a recipe on its reverse side. That extra touch by the maker is appreciated by this happy customer.
i used it now a few times, all in all its ok.
I would wish it's a little more intense.
If u use too much it starts to have a bitter after taste.
The product is GREAT, but must say, if you're expecting flavor that is like orange candy/orange soda, stick to other brands...this tastes like you're eating an orange or drinking orange juice. It definitely what I was looking for, but my daughter, who was using for a creamsicle smoothie, got a bit of a surprise!
Concentrated as promised and adds the natural citrus flavour. Very high quality product and I would recommend it to anyone. I am eager to try their other flavours.
We use this orange extract in a simmer pot along with cloves and cinnamon to make the office smell amazing. The refreshing orange notes that this product adds is amazing. Just 1/8 teaspoon is enough, because the strength of the product is so good. We also like to use it in hot tea to add a nice flavor. Great quality and value.",,
orange juice,mixer,shirley,"Florida's Natural Here's the big thing I learned: There aren't truly bad orange juices. There are ones that I'd choose over others, but in general, you're not going to be mad about tangy, sunshine-y beverages. That said, Florida's Natural was unfortunately very clearly at the bottom of the pile. Described as ""airplane OJ"" by one of the tasters, this was a bit too saccharine and concentrate-like. The pulp ratio was great, but it tasted a bit too far away from the real thing to be truly enjoyable. Simply Orange Simply Orange tasted quite a bit like the stuff you get at the mess hall at camp, but again, it's not bad. While not particularly robust, with a bit of a chemical tang in the aftertaste. Still, it wasn't too sweet and had that bitter, almost rind-y quality that makes it seem closer to the fruit itself. This isn't one for pulp fans, however—there's not a whole lot of texture here. Indian River Select Indian River Select, on the other hand, was definitely robust. It was nearly creamy—one taster described it as a ""melted Creamsicle."" It was sweet, but not too sweet, and its thicker texture and assertive flavor would lend it the strength to stand up for itself in a strong cocktail. Use this one for your mixing needs. Tropicana To me, this tastes like school mornings. It was what my family kept in the fridge, and drinking it now, I was relieved to find it was as well-balanced as I remember. With a good amount of pulp, a nice sweet-bitter balance, and a pleasant rind-esque bitterness, this was a good juice! The only downfall was a whisper of that stale concentrate-like chemical tang in the aftertaste. Still, this is a solid choice. Natalie's Orchid Island It was a close call between these two last entrants, and Natalie's Orchid Island is extremely delicious. Full-bodied, sweet, and with a bitterness that makes it taste straight from the fruit, I'm not sure anyone would guess it was bottled and not just squeezed. The only deterrent? It had slighly less pulp than I'd want from a fresh OJ. Kennesaw Kennesaw, on the other hand, was perfect. On my notes, I wrote ""Real. Deal."" And that sums it up: It has the perfect amount of citrusy sweetness and rindy bitterness, and the pulp levels are on point. The color nearly glows, and I wish I could burn a candle with its scent.

Table salt is a refined salt containing about 97 to 99 percent sodium chloride.[33][34][35] Usually, anticaking agents such as sodium aluminosilicate or magnesium carbonate are added to make it free-flowing. Iodized salt, containing potassium iodide, is widely available. Some people put a desiccant, such as a few grains of uncooked rice[36] or a saltine cracker, in their salt shakers to absorb extra moisture and help break up salt clumps that may otherwise form.[37]",,

smoked salt,mixer,shirley,"Smoked salt is an aromatic salt smoked with any number of select bark free woods for up to 14 days. The kind of wood used for smoking impacts the flavor, which can range from subtle to bold or even sweet. The most common choices are alder, apple wood, hickory, mesquite, and oak. Infused smoked salts like smoked bacon chipotle sea salt are very popular because of their dynamic flavor profiles.[1][2] Smoked salt is used to enhance the inherent flavors of a dish, while also imparting a smoky taste. It is suitable for vegetarians, often acting as a replacement for bacon crumbles. Smoked salt differs from smoke-flavored salt, as the latter contains a smoke-flavored additive, and is not classified as a natural salt product.",,
soda water or champagne,mixer,claire,"Champagne (/ʃæmˈpeɪn/, French: [ʃɑ̃paɲ]) is sparkling wine. Many people use the term Champagne as a generic term for sparkling wine but in some countries, it is illegal to label any product Champagne unless it both comes from the Champagne region and is produced under the rules of the appellation.[1] Specifically, in the EU countries, legally only that sparkling wine which comes from the Champagne region of France can be labelled as Champagne. Where EU law applies, this alcoholic drink is produced from grapes grown in the Champagne region of France following rules that demand, among other things, secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to create carbonation, specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes exclusively from specific parcels in the Champagne appellation and specific pressing regimes unique to the region.[2]


Vineyards in the Champagne region of France
Primarily, the grapes Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, and Chardonnay are used in the production of almost all Champagne, but a tiny amount of pinot blanc, pinot gris, arbane, and petit meslier are vinified as well. Champagne appellation law allows only grapes grown according to appellation rules in specifically designated plots within the appellation to be used in the production of Champagne.

Champagne became associated with royalty in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The leading manufacturers made efforts to associate their Champagnes with nobility and royalty through advertising and packaging, which led to popularity among the emerging middle class.[1] The most prestigious Champagne cellars are located in the cities of Reims and Epernay.

soy sauce,mixer,claire,"The taste of soy sauce is predominated by saltiness, followed by moderate umami, sweet taste, and finally slight bitterness, which is hard to perceive due to the masking effect of other tastes. The overall flavor of soy sauce is a result of the balance and interaction among different taste components. The saltiness is largely attributed to the presence of NaCl (common salt) in brine. The sugars hydrolyzed from starch add sweetness into soy sauce. Umami is largely caused by the presence of free amino acids. Besides, the interaction between glutamine and sodium cation may have given rise to sodium glutamate (MSG), which can further contribute to the umami flavor. Basic tastes can also be attributed to amino acids groups arranged in specific sequence. In soy sauce, it was found that ""amino acids were grouped as MSG-like (monosodium glutamate-like) (Asp+Glu), sweet (Ala+Gly+Ser+Thr), bitter (Arg+His+Ile+Leu+Met+Phe+Trp+Try+Val), and tasteless (Cys+Lys+Pro)"".[37]

Despite a large variety of volatile and odorant compounds that have been identified in soy sauce, the food product per se does not present a strong aroma. Alcohols, acids, esters, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, heterocyclic compounds, alkynes and benzenes are identified in Chinese soy sauces.[33] An explanation for this observation is that the aroma of soy sauce does not depend largely on the aroma-active compounds. The subtle aroma is a result of a ""critical balance"" achieved among all volatile and odorant compounds, whose respective concentrations are relatively low.",,

sparkling water,mixer,claire,"Carbonated water or soda water is water containing dissolved carbon dioxide gas, either artificially injected under pressure or occurring due to natural geological processes. Carbonation causes small bubbles to form, giving the water an effervescent quality. Common forms include sparkling natural mineral water, club soda, and commercially produced sparkling water (also known as 'seltzer water' in the U.S.).

Club soda, sparkling mineral water, seltzer and many other sparkling waters contain added or dissolved minerals such as potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, or potassium sulfate. These occur naturally in some mineral waters but are also commonly added artificially to man-made waters to mimic a natural flavor profile. Various carbonated waters are sold in bottles and cans, with some also produced on demand by commercial carbonation systems in bars and restaurants, or made at home using a carbon dioxide cartridge.

It is thought the first person to aerate water with carbon dioxide was William Brownrigg in 1740, although he never published a paper.[1] Carbonated water was independently accidentally invented by Joseph Priestley in 1767 when he discovered a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide after suspending a bowl of water above a beer vat at a brewery in Leeds, England.[2] He wrote of the ""peculiar satisfaction"" he found in drinking it, and in 1772 he published a paper entitled Impregnating Water with Fixed Air.[3][4] Priestley’s apparatus, which featured a bladder between the generator and the absorption tank to regulate the flow of carbon dioxide, was soon joined by a wide range of others, but it wasn’t until 1781 that carbonated water began being produced on a large scale with the establishment of companies specialized in producing artificial mineral water.[2] The first factory was built by Thomas Henry of Manchester, England.[2] Henry replaced the bladder in Priestley’s system with large bellows.[2]

While Priestley is regarded as “the father of the soft drink,” he did not benefit financially from his invention.[2] He did however receive scientific recognition when the Council of the Royal Society “were moved to reward its discoverer with the Copley Medal” in 1772.[5]",,
split vanilla pod,mixer,claire,"Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (V. planifolia). The word vanilla, derived from vainilla, the diminutive of the Spanish word vaina (vaina itself meaning a sheath or a pod), is translated simply as ""little pod"".[1] Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called tlīlxochitl by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.[2]

Pollination is required to set the vanilla fruit from which the flavoring is derived. In 1837, Belgian botanist Charles François Antoine Morren discovered this fact and pioneered a method of artificially pollinating the plant.[3] The method proved financially unworkable and was not deployed commercially.[4] In 1841, Edmond Albius, a slave who lived on the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean, discovered at the age of 12 that the plant could be hand-pollinated. Hand-pollination allowed global cultivation of the plant.[5]


Vanilla tahitensis in cultivation
Three major species of vanilla currently are grown globally, all of which derive from a species originally found in Mesoamerica, including parts of modern-day Mexico.[6] They are V. planifolia (syn. V. fragrans), grown on Madagascar, Réunion, and other tropical areas along the Indian Ocean; V. tahitensis, grown in the South Pacific; and V. pompona, found in the West Indies, Central America, and South America.[7] The majority of the world's vanilla is the V. planifolia species, more commonly known as Bourbon vanilla (after the former name of Réunion, Île Bourbon) or Madagascar vanilla, which is produced in Madagascar and neighboring islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean, and in Indonesia. Combined, Madagascar and Indonesia produce two-thirds of the world's supply of vanilla.

Vanilla is the second-most expensive spice after saffron[8][9] because growing the vanilla seed pods is labor-intensive.[9] Despite the expense, vanilla is highly valued for its flavor.[10] As a result, vanilla is widely used in both commercial and domestic baking, perfume manufacture, and aromatherapy.",,

"'strong coffee, 'chilled'",mixer,claire,"Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.[2] Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are C. arabica and C. robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as ""beans"") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.

Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,[4] and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative. Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption lowers the risk of some diseases, although those long-term studies are of generally poor quality.[5]

The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines.[6] It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared. But the coffee seeds had to be first exported from East Africa to Yemen, as Coffea arabica is thought to have been indigenous to the former.[7] The Yemenis obtained their coffee via Somali traders from Berbera (who in turn procured the beans from the Ethiopian Highlands) and began to cultivate the seed. By the 16th century, the drink had reached Persia, Turkey, and North Africa. From there, it spread to Europe and the rest of the world.

As of 2016, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing one-third of the world total. Coffee is a major export commodity, being the top legal agricultural export for numerous countries.[4][8][not in citation given] It is one of the most valuable commodities exported by developing countries. Green, unroasted coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world.[9] Some controversy has been associated with coffee cultivation and the way developed countries trade with developing nations, as well as the impact on the environment with regards to the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use. Consequently, the markets for fair trade and organic coffee are expanding, notably in the USA.[10]",,
sugar or maple syrup,mixer,claire,"Maple syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, although it can also be made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.

Maple syrup was first collected and used by the indigenous peoples of North America, and the practice was adopted by European settlers, who gradually refined production methods. Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing. The Canadian province of Quebec is by far the largest producer, responsible for 70 percent of the world's output; Canadian exports of maple syrup in 2016 were C$ 487 million (about US$ 360 million), with Quebec accounting for some 90 percent of this total.[1][2]

Maple syrup is graded according to the Canada, United States, or Vermont scales based on its density and translucency. Sucrose is the most prevalent sugar in maple syrup. In Canada, syrups must be made exclusively from maple sap to qualify as maple syrup and must also be at least 66 percent sugar.[3] In the United States, a syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap to be labelled as ""maple"", though states such as Vermont and New York have more restrictive definitions.

Maple syrup is often used as a condiment for pancakes, waffles, French toast, oatmeal or porridge. It is also used as an ingredient in baking and as a sweetener or flavouring agent. Culinary experts have praised its unique flavour, although the chemistry responsible is not fully understood.[4]",,
sugar syrup,mixer,claire,"In cooking, a syrup or sirup (from Arabic: شراب‎; sharāb, beverage, wine and Latin: sirupus)[1] is a condiment that is a thick, viscous liquid consisting primarily of a solution of sugar in water, containing a large amount of dissolved sugars but showing little tendency to deposit crystals. Its consistency is similar to that of molasses. The viscosity arises from the multiple hydrogen bonds between the dissolved sugar, which has many hydroxyl (OH) groups.

Syrups can be made by dissolving sugar in water or by reducing naturally sweet juices such as cane juice, sorghum juice, maple sap or agave nectar. Corn syrup is made from corn starch using an enzymatic process that converts it to sugars.",,
sugar,mixer,claire,"Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. The various types of sugar are derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. ""Table sugar"" or ""granulated sugar"" refers to sucrose, a disaccharide of glucose and fructose. In the body, sucrose is hydrolysed into fructose and glucose.

Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants, but sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet, making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar. Sugarcane originated in tropical Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia,[1] and is known of from before 6,000 BP, sugar beet was first described in writing (1575) by Olivier de Serres and originated in southwestern, northern and Southeast Europe along the Atlantic coasts and the Mediterranean Sea, in North Africa, Macaronesia, to Western Asia. In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes. Other disaccharides include maltose (from malted grain) and lactose (from milk). Longer chains of sugar molecules are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. Some other chemical substances, such as glycerol and sugar alcohols, may have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugar.

Sucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g. cookies and cakes), is sometimes added to commercially available beverages, and may be used by people as a sweetener for foods (e.g. toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g. coffee and tea). The average person consumes about 24 kilograms (53 lb) of sugar each year, or 33.1 kilograms (73 lb) in developed countries, equivalent to over 260 food calories per day. As sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high in sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to human health. Excessive consumption of sugar has been implicated in the onset of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and tooth decay. Numerous studies have tried to clarify those implications, but with varying results, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that consume little or no sugar. In 2015, the World Health Organization recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10%, and encouraged a reduction to below 5%, of their total energy intake.[2]",,

The definitions of tomato purée vary from country to country. In the U.S., tomato purée is a processed food product, usually consisting of only tomatoes, but can also be found in the seasoned form. It differs from tomato sauce or tomato paste in consistency and content; tomato purée generally lacks the additives common to a complete tomato sauce and does not have the thickness of paste.[4]

To prepare tomato purée, ripe tomatoes are washed and the sepals and stem are removed. Some processors remove the skin of the tomato as well. The fruit flesh is then mashed or mechanically chopped to the desired consistency.

Tomato purée can be used in soups, stews, sauces, or any other dish where the tomato flavor is desired, but not the texture. It is less often used by professional chefs, who find it to have an overly cooked flavor compared to other forms of canned tomatoes. This is sometimes a non-issue, as in long-cooked dishes, but in quick sauces such as a marinara sauce it is undesirable.

Tomato purée has approx 16% solids content. Lower solids content is due to filtering, higher content is due to concentration of the product.

unsalted butter,mixer,claire,"Butter (/ˈbʌtə/) is a dairy product with high butterfat content which is solid when chilled and at room temperature in some regions, and liquid when warmed. It is made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk to separate the butterfat from the buttermilk. It is generally used as a spread on plain or toasted bread products and a condiment on cooked vegetables, as well as in cooking, such as baking, sauce making, and pan frying. Butter consists of butterfat, milk proteins and water, and often added salt. Most frequently made from cow's milk, butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks. Salt (such as dairy salt), flavorings (such as garlic) and preservatives are sometimes added to butter. Rendering butter, removing the water and milk solids, produces clarified butter or ghee, which is almost entirely butterfat. Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream, where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers. Butter remains a firm solid when refrigerated, but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature, and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32 to 35 °C (90 to 95 °F). The density of butter is 911 grams per Litre (0.950 lb per US pint).[1] It generally has a pale yellow color, but varies from deep yellow to nearly white.

vanilla extract,mixer,claire,"Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (V. planifolia). The word vanilla, derived from vainilla, the diminutive of the Spanish word vaina (vaina itself meaning a sheath or a pod), is translated simply as ""little pod"".[1] Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called tlīlxochitl by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.[2]

Pollination is required to set the vanilla fruit from which the flavoring is derived. In 1837, Belgian botanist Charles François Antoine Morren discovered this fact and pioneered a method of artificially pollinating the plant.[3] The method proved financially unworkable and was not deployed commercially.[4] In 1841, Edmond Albius, a slave who lived on the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean, discovered at the age of 12 that the plant could be hand-pollinated. Hand-pollination allowed global cultivation of the plant.[5]

vanilla ice cream,mixer,claire,"Vanilla is frequently used to flavor ice cream, especially in North America and Europe.[1] Vanilla ice cream, like other flavors of ice cream, was originally created by cooling a mixture made of cream, sugar, and vanilla above a container of ice and salt.[2] The type of vanilla used to flavor ice cream varies by location. In North America and Europe consumers are interested in a more prominent, smoky flavor, while in Ireland they want a more anise-like flavor. [1] To create the smooth consistency of ice cream, the mixture has to be stirred occasionally and then returned to the container of ice and salt to continue the solidification process.[2] According to Iced: 180 Very Cool Concoctions, many people often consider vanilla to be the ""default"" or ""plain"" flavor of ice cream (see ""Plain vanilla"").[3]",,

violet spray,mixer,claire,"Viola (US: /vaɪˈoʊlə/ and UK: /ˈvaɪ.ələ/)[1] is a genus of flowering plants in the violet family Violaceae. It is the largest genus in the family, containing between 525 and 600 species.[2][3] Most species are found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere; however, some are also found in widely divergent areas such as Hawaii, Australasia, and the Andes.

Some Viola species are perennial plants, some are annual plants, and a few are small shrubs. A large number of species, varieties and cultivars are grown in gardens for their ornamental flowers. In horticulture the term pansy is normally used for those multi-colored, large-flowered cultivars which are raised annually or biennially from seed and used extensively in bedding. The terms viola and violet are normally reserved for small-flowered annuals or perennials, including the wild species.[4][5]",,
wasabi,mixer,claire,"Wasabi (Japanese ワサビ, わさび or 山葵; Eutrema japonicum or Wasabia japonica)[1] or Japanese horseradish[2] is a plant of the Brassicaceae family, which also includes horseradish and mustard in other genera. A paste made from its ground rhizomes is used as a pungent condiment for sushi and other foods. It is similar in taste to hot mustard or horseradish rather than chili peppers in that it stimulates the nose more than the tongue.

The plant grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan. The two main cultivars in the marketplace are E. japonicum 'Daruma' and 'Mazuma', but there are many others.[3] The oldest record of wasabi as a food dates to the 8th century CE.[4] The popularity of wasabi in English-speaking countries has tracked that of sushi, growing steadily starting in about 1980.[5]

Due to issues that limit the Japanese Wasabi plant's mass cultivation and thus increase its price and decrease availability, outside of Japan the Western Horseradish plant is generally used in place of the Japanese Horseradish. This version is commonly referred to as ""Western Wasabi"" in Japan.",,

white caster sugar,mixer,claire,"Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. The various types of sugar are derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. ""Table sugar"" or ""granulated sugar"" refers to sucrose, a disaccharide of glucose and fructose. In the body, sucrose is hydrolysed into fructose and glucose.

Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants, but sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet, making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar. Sugarcane originated in tropical Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia,[1] and is known of from before 6,000 BP, sugar beet was first described in writing (1575) by Olivier de Serres and originated in southwestern, northern and Southeast Europe along the Atlantic coasts and the Mediterranean Sea, in North Africa, Macaronesia, to Western Asia.

Longer chains of sugar molecules are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. Some other chemical substances, such as glycerol and sugar alcohols, may have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugar.

Sucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g. cookies and cakes), is sometimes added to commercially available beverages, and may be used by people as a sweetener for foods (e.g. toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g. coffee and tea). The average person consumes about 24 kilograms (53 lb) of sugar each year, or 33.1 kilograms (73 lb) in developed countries, equivalent to over 260 food calories per day. As sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high in sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to human health. Excessive consumption of sugar has been implicated in the onset of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and tooth decay. Numerous studies have tried to clarify those implications, but with varying results, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that consume little or no sugar. In 2015, the World Health Organization recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10%, and encouraged a reduction to below 5%, of their total energy intake.[2]",,

In North America, the most common grape juice is purple and made from Concord grapes while white grape juice is commonly made from Niagara grapes, both of which are varieties of native American grapes, a different species from European wine grapes. In California, Sultana (known there as Thompson Seedless) grapes are sometimes diverted from the raisin or table market to produce white juice.[1]

Sometimes alternative processes are used for removing the outer pepper from the seed, including removing the outer layer through mechanical, chemical, or biological methods.[8] Ground white pepper is used in Chinese and Thai cuisine, but also in salads, cream sauces, light-coloured sauces, and mashed potatoes (as a substitute, because black pepper would visibly stand out).

It contains many other nutrients[1] including protein and lactose. Interspecies consumption of milk is not uncommon, particularly among humans, many of whom consume the milk of other mammals.[2][3]

As an agricultural product, milk, also called dairy milk, is extracted from farm animals during or soon after pregnancy. Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011,[4] from 260 million dairy cows.[5] India is the world's largest producer of milk, and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder, yet it exports few other milk products.[6][7] The ever increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future.[8] The United States, India, China and Brazil are the world's largest exporters of milk and milk products.[9] China and Russia were the world's largest importers of milk and milk products until 2016 when both countries became self-sufficient, contributing to a worldwide glut of milk.[10]

December 29, 2014
Color: N/aVerified Purchase
While I love angostura bitters, I wanted to give this packaging a four star review instead of five as a bit of a warning--a 16oz bottle is extremely difficult to ""dash"" from. I didn't think about that before I bought this, my fault of course, but I hope you will. The normal 4oz bottle of ango is the perfect size for dashing in a drink. This one is tough...the weight of the liquid behind itself when you tip it over really gushes the bitters out, I usually end up spilling some with this bottle. And value wise this bottle was only a dollar or two cheaper than buying four bottles of the normal size. So unless you are batching large amounts of cocktails, I would say stick to the small bottle!

If you enjoy Bailey's and you're a fan of chocolate, you'll probably really enjoy this liqueur. It's delicious and rich in flavour, with a smooth and creamy texture.

While it's not the sort of thing I'd want to drink every day, this is perfect for special occasions (Christmas) or as a gift. It comes in a deluxe bottle, and looks very decorative.

You get 500ml for about £15. This is expensive, when compared to standard Bailey's and the other flavoured Bailey's. For example, a 1lt bottle of orange Bailey's costs approx. £15 ... meaning that this chocolate flavoured drink is twice as expensive!

Regardless of the cost, it's an extremely tasty liqueur - and I recommend it (for anyone who enjoys a rich chocolate flavour).

I have great problem with this...as it simply does not smell or taste the same...am i wrong !!!

Bells - no longer ""8 Years"" ???
I have been drinking Bells 8 Year Old as my standard blend for decades. It has always been my yardstick for all other 'standard' blends. However I have just realised that the ""8 Years"" tag on the label has dis-appeared. It may be my imagination, but I also sense that some of the richness and the nose has gone with it. Anybody else noticed this?",

These bitters are awesome! I used them to make a modified bees knees cocktail to try to evoke earl grey flavors without using the tea itself and it worked out great. There were some stock/shipping difficulties with my order but the company was so helpful and kind in getting it all straightened out. Thank you again!!

Wow! Where has this stuff been all my life? I purchased this for my husband, a Manhattan lover, for Christmas, and it's delicious in cocktails, but a couple of drops puts salad dressings and hot cocoa over the top into the realm of the sublime. It needs to be added to something sweet/savory--it was so delicious in cocoa, I tried some on its own, but ""bitter"" was the word--paired with a vinaigrette or cherry, or chocolate, wow, oh, wow, oh wow!

You're welcome.

I love this bitters. Here is a recipe for my new favorite drink-
This is essentially a Utah sazerac, traditionally made with Absinthe which is very expensive and nearly unavailable at the state run liquor stores here. I substitute a little ouzo, I cannot stress enough how little. I just 'wash' the glass with it and let any extra run out before continuing.
2oz. of High West Double Rye
The barest whisper of Ouzo, just the tiniest splash.
1-2 dashes of Fee Brothers Black Walnut Bitters ( I like 2 but 1 is probably sufficient.)
One decent sized piece of Orange Peel, the less of the white bitter pith the better, I like to shoot for one thumb sized peel of just the zest part of the peel.
Throw it all together in a rocks glass over ice and enjoy.",

Silver Rum With Personality
It seems that with every subsequent product, Captain Morgan offer something decidedly better than their traditional spiced rum (at least, before being put in a cocktail). Unlike their previous Silver Spiced Rum, Captain Morgan White Rum has none of the spiced characteristics that have come to define the brand, which might sound counter-intuitive, but they somehow made it work.

Captain Morgan White is, as you'd probably expect, a sweet spirit that, for my taste buds, helped make the factors which separate white rum and vodka distinct. The rum can easily be enjoyed on its own, but I see plenty of potential for this in cocktails, much as Captain Morgan Spiced Rum leans itself towards.",

champagne,alcohol,sindoori,"Champagne (/ʃæmˈpeɪn/, French: [ʃɑ̃paɲ]) is sparkling wine. Many people use the term Champagne as a generic term for sparkling wine but in some countries, it is illegal to label any product Champagne unless it both comes from the Champagne region and is produced under the rules of the appellation.[1] Specifically, in the EU countries, legally only that sparkling wine which comes from the Champagne region of France can be labelled as Champagne. Where EU law applies, this alcoholic drink is produced from grapes grown in the Champagne region of France following rules that demand, among other things, secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to create carbonation, specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes exclusively from specific parcels in the Champagne appellation and specific pressing regimes unique to the region.[2]


Vineyards in the Champagne region of France
Primarily, the grapes Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, and Chardonnay are used in the production of almost all Champagne, but a tiny amount of pinot blanc, pinot gris, arbane, and petit meslier are vinified as well. Champagne appellation law allows only grapes grown according to appellation rules in specifically designated plots within the appellation to be used in the production of Champagne.

Champagne became associated with royalty in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The leading manufacturers made efforts to associate their Champagnes with nobility and royalty through advertising and packaging, which led to popularity among the emerging middle class.[1] The most prestigious Champagne cellars are located in the cities of Reims and Epernay.

New bitters for a new era of cocktails. Deep chocolate notes are supported by classic bitter flavors and accented with a hint of spice. Plays perfectly with most dark spirits, rums and tequilas. The Bitter Truth Chocolate Bitters blur the lines between old world bitters and new world flavors. Add a dash to a Manhattan to start exploring its complex flavor or use in a Tequila Old Fashioned to bring forward the spirit’s vegetal flavors.

Seriously, it's that impressive. Even drinks that don't need chocolate can benefit from a drop of this richness.

History
Chocolate liqueur is not a new invention. There is mention, in French, of producing and selling chocolate en liqueur as early as 1666.[1] Context suggests this is a chocolate liqueur, not a chocolate liquor or other chocolate beverage. In New England prior to the 18th century American Revolution, a ""chocolate wine"" was popular. Its ingredients included sherry, port, chocolate, and sugar.[2] A French manual published in 1780 also describes chocolate liqueur.[3] An 1803 French pharmacy manual includes a recipe for a chocolate liqueur (ratafia de chocolat, also ratafia de cacao).[4] An early 19th-century American cookbook, published in 1825 and preserved in an historical archive in South Carolina, includes a similar recipe.[1] Throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th century, manuals and encyclopedias in French, English, and Spanish give similar recipes. A late 19th century food science manual gives a recipe that includes techniques for clarifying and coloring the liqueur.[5] A similar early 20th century manual gives four recipes.[6]

There are several brands of chocolate liqueur on the market; this is attributed to a 1990s ""chocolate craze"".[2]

Recipes
Early 19th century recipes for chocolate liqueur featured whole cocoa beans.[4] A basic modern recipe[7] for making chocolate liqueur at home lists the ingredients chocolate extract, vanilla extract, vodka, and simple syrup. To keep the chocolate extract in suspension and make the liqueur thicker, glycerine may be added. In its purest form, chocolate liqueur is clear; coloring may be added.[5] Recipes for home-made chocolate liqueurs may also include raw eggs as an ingredient, presenting a risk of salmonellosis. Reasonable safety may be achieved by combining the eggs with the alcohol before other ingredients.[8] Earlier, liquor was made by adding the cocoa beans to classic liqueur. Modern chocolate wine can be considered as a subspecies of chocolate liquor.[9]

Uses
Chocolate liqueur can be consumed straight, as an after dinner drink rather than as aperitif. It is used in mixed drinks and in desserts, especially in dessert sauces, cakes, and truffles. A food writer notes that many recipes for chocolate truffle add a small amount of chocolate liqueur to melted chocolate, and warns that adding the liqueur often causes the chocolate to seize.[10] One of the more unusual uses is in chocolate rolled fondant.[11]

Arguably the most controversial use may be in connection with a scandal concerning the provenance of certain 17th century bottles of wines said to have belonged to Thomas Jefferson, and traded by Hardy Rodenstock. Benjamin Wallace writes in his book The Billionaire's Vinegar that at a wine tasting of 19th century wines from Château Latour, provided by Rodenstock, several people noted the wines had a flavor of chocolate liqueur and were fakes.[12] Wine and chocolate are a classic flavor pairing, and this is reflected in some cocktails that combine a strong red wine with a dash of chocolate liqueu",,
cîroc® vodka,alcohol,sindoori,"A high-quality vodka from Ciroc, made from 'snap frost' grapes that are cold fermented before being distilled in a combination of steel and copper stills.

clove bitters,alcohol,sindoori,"The quintessential Christmas spice, cloves add a powerful and intense aroma to cocktails and recipes of all descriptions.

These Single-Varietal bitters are made using only three ingredients; the spirit (High-proof Dark Rum) and Cloves with natural bittering agents.

Used sparingly, these bitters will add depth and intensity to most whisky cocktails, and are especially good in an old-fashioned made with high quality Bourbon, where the Whiskey is really required to shine through.",,
coffee bitters,alcohol,sindoori,"Coffee has become a Saturday morning tradition for Kendall and me.  Before we walk to the market we meet at the best coffee shop in our neighborhood, Contraband, and pick up a couple Cappuccinos to go. Nice, strong espresso with a perfect pillow of frothed milk. They’re heavenly. We don’t drink them every Saturday to make us more alert or to get us energized. Although the caffeine is a positive side effect of the beverage, we drink coffee for the ritual and taste.  We drink our coffee slowly, enjoying each sip—this is how I believe a cocktail should be enjoyed as well.
 

For our second batch of bitters, we decided to go with coffee. Coffee is relaxing, it smells good, it tastes good, and it brings people together… who doesn’t love it? A few dashes of Coffee Bitters in a whisky or rum cocktail just sounds like a recipe for happiness. The Coffee-Pecan Bitters recipe in Brad T. Parsons’ Bitters book inspires the recipe for my Coffee Bitters. If you’re thinking about making your own bitters, or just want to learn some cool facts about bitters, I highly suggest reading it.
 

IMG_2699.jpg
To make my Coffee Bitters, we combined ½ cup cracked coffee beans, 4 cracked cacao beans, ¼ teaspoon of black peppercorns, ½ teaspoon cassia chips, ½ teaspoon wild cherry bark, and 2 star anise in a quart-sized mason jar. For the coffee beans, don’t skimp on the quality. If you use crappy ingredients, you’re going to have crappy bitters. We used Contraband’s Yemen coffee, which is a medium roast with a sweet and earthy flavor—great stuff. We then drowned the coffee-bark-spice mixture in 2 cups of Wild Turkey 101 (the combination of the bourbon and coffee smells INCREDIBLE, by the way) and kept the jar at room temperature for 2 weeks, shaking the jar once a day.
IMG_2742_2.JPG
After the 2 weeks were up, we strained the liquid through cheesecloth to remove the solids, and then let the solids simmer in a saucepan with 1 cup of water for about 10 minutes. After it cooled, we put the contents of the saucepan in a separate mason jar and let it sit for another week, giving the jar a shake once a day.

IMG_3039.jpg
After waiting for another week, we strained out the solids and added the liquid to the other mason jar, which contained the original bourbon solution, along with 2 tablespoons of molasses. Three more days of waiting, one more run through cheesecloth, and finally, they’re done!",,

This tequila should be drank straight, no mix. It is good at room temp. but if you let it get really cold on ice it is even better. I've tried quite a few of the high end tequilas and I think this is my favourite.

Tequila old fashioned with this, is quiet possibly the best tasting drink known to man!! Well aslong as its made with my specific extra ingredients

William Evans 17 February 2012
I highly recommend Reposados and they don't come much better than this. Reposados are more complex than Blancos and have more of a neautral flavour than Anejos. Try it in a normal Margarita but with 2 teaspoons of Honey instead of sugar or in an Mayan. 2 ounce Tequila 1 and a half of freshly pressed pinapple juice a 3 quarter ounce shot of Kahlua. Just shake it all and serve in a highball glass and top the drink up with soda water. DIVINE.

I brought a bottle of this back from Mexico earlier this year. Having only ever tried the more 'popular' brands available on the British market, my opinion of tequila as a drink was closely linked with pain and suffering and memory loss.

Chambord is made from red and black raspberries, Madagascar vanilla, Moroccan citrus peel, honey and cognac.

History
The Chambord brand was founded in 1982.[2] The drink was inspired by raspberry liqueur made in the Loire Valley in the late 1600s,[2] said to have been introduced to Louis XIV during one of his visits to the château de Chambord. It was common during that time for liqueurs and cognac to be consumed with elegant meals.

In 2006, the Chambord product brand was acquired by the Brown-Forman Corporation.[1]

Production
Chambord is produced in the Loire Valley from red and black raspberries, Madagascar vanilla, Moroccan citrus peel, honey and cognac. Whole raspberries and blackberries are steeped in French spirits for a period of several weeks to produce a fruit infusion.

After the infusion is extracted, a second set of spirits is added to the fruit and allowed to rest for a few weeks. After this second infusion is drawn off, the remaining fruit is pressed to obtain the natural sugars and juice. The fruit-infused spirits and juices from the final pressing are then combined, and finally, the berry infusion is married with a proprietary blend of cognac, natural vanilla extract, black raspberries, citrus peel, honey, and herbs and spices. The liqueur is 16.5% alcohol by volume.

Bottle
Chambord comes in a spherical bottle. Until mid-2010, the bottle came with a metallic gold plastic lettered 'belt' around the middle, and a crown atop its lid. The bottle was modeled after a globus cruciger.

In the U.S. market, the manufacturer began using a different bottle design in summer 2010, with modifications to the belt, lid and other elements.[3]

In addition to redesigning the bottle for the traditional Chambord liqueur, the manufacturer has also begun using the Chambord brand name on a flavoured vodka.[3]

Cocktails
Common drinks made from Chambord include the Raspberry Margarita, French Manhattan, Rolling Green (cocktail)[vodka,lemonade] Butler Miller (Chambord Vodka Gimlet),[4] Kir Impérial (Chambord and champagne), Chambord Daiquiri, Chambord Royal Spritzer, Lemonado (Vodka, lemonade and splash of Chambord), Little Purple Men, The Purple Hooter Shooter, Sour Grapes, Black Opal, Peanut Butter and Jelly (with Frangelico or Castries Peanut Cream), Grape Crush, the ""Blood of Christ"", Grateful Dead, and the French Martini. The French Martini started the ""cocktails as a Martini"" craze.[5]",,

We take the finest wild sloe berries and steep them gently, before adding Gordon's gin. The result is a wonderful tipple that marries the dryness of Gordon's with cassis sweetness – perfect in cocktails, as an alternative G&T, or simply on its own (but always with friends!).

Fruity and delicious with bite
Don't believe the nay sayers. This will lift deserts and is excellent and different as a liqueur. It is sharper and less sweet than home made Sloe Gins I have had, which makes it a Marmite product.

guiness®,alcohol,sindoori,"Guinness (/ˈɡɪnɪs/) is a dark Irish dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness at St. James's Gate, Dublin, Ireland, in 1759. It is one of the most successful beer brands worldwide, brewed in almost 50 countries, and available in over 120. [1][2] Sales in 2011 amounted to 850 million litres (220,000,000 US gal).[1] It is popular with the Irish, both in Ireland and abroad. In spite of declining consumption since 2001,[3] it is still the best-selling alcoholic drink in Ireland.[4][5] where Guinness & Co. Brewery makes almost €2 billion worth annually.","Date: Gotta love illegible date codes, I think this is a late 2018 can, consumed on 03/28/19.

Appearance: Pours out like a coke, then puts on a beautiful cascading act in the glass. Once this is finished, it takes on the traditional stout look with ruby color around the bottom. Guinness produces over two fingers of what has to be the most creamy sand colored head that a beer ever produced.

Aroma: Roasted malts, light coffee, and chocolate are all on the nose with the malts actually seeming to have so depth to them. No one aspect is very pronounced, but it smell nice.

Taste: Here is where we have some issues. First, Guinness is terribly thin, not a whole lot more substantial than water. The taste, while presenting a pleasant dry roasted bitter malt profile, never really amounts to much else. Yes, there is some chocolate and a mild coffee flavors, but this is a beer seems fearful of being what it should be. The widget in the can does give it a ridiculously creamy texture though. To sum Guinness up, it has been nice to revisit and old staple, but it simply cannot stand up to its craft brethren such as Deschutes Black Butte Porter. This St. Patrick's Day leftover reminds my why I only buy this once a year.

Poured from a 

Look: Pours a beautiful dark brown, almost black color. Rich and creamy with an absolutely perfect, creamy, white-tan head.
Smell: Aroma of bittersweet cocoa, Some roasted grain malt in the background underneath. Some bitterness.
Taste: Flavor of milk chocolate, roasted grain malt and even some dark coffee in the background. Encompasses the full flavor profile of a stout.
Feel: Oh sooo smooth. Milky. Creamy. Goes down like chocolate milk. It is no wonder the Irish picked this as their staple beer.

Overall: When you want a light beer and are considering any of American macrolagers, stop yourself and ask yourself rather whether you want a Guinness. This beer incorporates chocolate, roasted grain malts, and even coffee into a drinkable Irish stout that is so smooth, you'll ask yourself why you don't live in Ireland. It defines the light beer version of a stout. So well done and a tradition, you can't go wrong with a Guinness.

I started drinking Guinness in an Irish bed and breakfast, served to me by a lovely Irish lass just after St. Patrick's Day in 1998. Since then I have had a few every March in celebration. It used to be my gold standard for a stout, and is still good, but lacks some of the character of others with coffee and/or chocolate notes. The beer pours a wonderful dark black and I love watching the bubbles go down the side of the glass. It is not as bitter as I remember, probably due to changing tastes on my part, and has a smooth creamy taste that lingers on the tongue. Overall I quite like it, but not near enough to have an exclusive relationship with it.

From a nitro can. Black in color. Poured with a moderate, creamy, almond white foam with excellent retention. Dark malt and light roasted malt aromas. Medium light bodied with a light creamy feel. Dark malt flavors up front that slowly turn roasty. Roasted flavor expands through the middle introducing bitter roasted flavors and charred malt near the end. Finished dryly with lingering bitter, charred malt flavors that slowly fade. Great look and pleasant aromas. Feel is generally thin and the charred malt flavors hurt the drinkability. Their foreign export stout is far better.

Poured from a 

Look: Pours a beautiful dark brown, almost black color. Rich and creamy with an absolutely perfect, creamy, white-tan head.
Smell: Aroma of bittersweet cocoa, Some roasted grain malt in the background underneath. Some bitterness.
Taste: Flavor of milk chocolate, roasted grain malt and even some dark coffee in the background. Encompasses the full flavor profile of a stout.
Feel: Oh sooo smooth. Milky. Creamy. Goes down like chocolate milk. It is no wonder the Irish picked this as their staple beer.

Overall: When you want a light beer and are considering any of American macrolagers, stop yourself and ask yourself rather whether you want a Guinness. This beer incorporates chocolate, roasted grain malts, and even coffee into a drinkable Irish stout that is so smooth, you'll ask yourself why you don't live in Ireland. It defines the light beer version of a stout. So well done and a tradition, you can't go wrong with a Guinness.

I started drinking Guinness in an Irish bed and breakfast, served to me by a lovely Irish lass just after St. Patrick's Day in 1998. Since then I have had a few every March in celebration. It used to be my gold standard for a stout, and is still good, but lacks some of the character of others with coffee and/or chocolate notes. The beer pours a wonderful dark black and I love watching the bubbles go down the side of the glass. It is not as bitter as I remember, probably due to changing tastes on my part, and has a smooth creamy taste that lingers on the tongue. Overall I quite like it, but not near enough to have an exclusive relationship with it.

From a nitro can. Black in color. Poured with a moderate, creamy, almond white foam with excellent retention. Dark malt and light roasted malt aromas. Medium light bodied with a light creamy feel. Dark malt flavors up front that slowly turn roasty. Roasted flavor expands through the middle introducing bitter roasted flavors and charred malt near the end. Finished dryly with lingering bitter, charred malt flavors that slowly fade. Great look and pleasant aromas. Feel is generally thin and the charred malt flavors hurt the drinkability. Their foreign export stout is far better.

Arguably the most hit or miss beer in the world Guinness has possibly the strongest head of any beer and a strong often creamy flavour but the problem with Guinness is unless it's stored properly it'll taste foul and bitter basically if you want great Guinness drink it in Ireland or somewhere that knows how to serve it
When it is stored and served properly it's probably one of the most delicious beers around with a smooth and soft texture and delicious taste

A classic. A bit overblown, but still decent. Perfect creamy head. Served ice cold. Watery as a stout should be, with some roasted and malty notes. Far not the best stout, but might be the best in the mass-market.",
haig club™,alcohol,shirley,"David Beckham has made his mark in the world of whisky with the launch of Haig Club. A light and sweet grain whisky, Haig Club is aimed at drinkers who have yet to be won over by whisky’s charms. Named after John Haig, the founder of Cameronbridge distillery (where the whisky is made), Haig Club is superb over ice, in long drinks or in short cocktails – it’s an easy-drinking dram that will win anyone over. Nose: Toffee and bananas up front, with green grassy notes, and gentle ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon spiciness. Palate: Sweet and creamy to start, with soft caramel and toffee. Lemon peel zestiness develops, with tingly cinnamon. Creamy lemon posset with a crunchy bar? Finish: Spice, toffee, soft anise and a touch of warmth. Comment: Light and sweet with more complexity than you might expect. It's not a whisky that you'll be sitting down to examine over hours, but it does have good flavours, that are strong enough to shine through even when mixed.","a gift which i’m afraid will end up in the bin. now i know why i always buy single malt whisky.really rather good. not to everyone’s taste clearly, but i enjoyed it.i can only describe this as bad. effective marketing made me buy this but other than that it doesn't offer much. not smooth, not enjoyable.very smooth. i love it.not at all pleasant, i'm not even sure this actually tastes like whisky at all. it has a very strange chemical flavour to it.i’m a fledgling whisky enthusiast and at first i tried to mentally justify the horrid taste of this whisky as it’s “character” and assumed that i was the one who couldn’t appreciate its qualities. well, with more experience under my belt i can say with confidence that this whiskey is horrid. it smells like acetone, has no real depth or flavour other than setting your mouth on fire with its harshness.can't stand single malt, but this went down very well.this whisky is awful. i'd steer clear of it unless you fancy blowing 40 quid on a drink to mix with soft drinks. very overpriced.it's reasonably smooth, and relatively easy to drink, but boy oh boy does it lack character. i'm relieved that it was a gift, as i now know never to exchange my own money for another bottle. i can see that there would obviously be an audience for this, but i personally prefer the complexity of many alternative single malts.this is the worst ""scotch"" i have ever tasted. i kept drinking it (it was a gift) out of respect for the person who gave it to me. i hoped my opinion of it would improve as i pushed on, but it didn't. smells like paint thinner. tastes like paint thinner. it is labeled as ""single grain"" and not ""single malt"". i'm not sure what that means, but in hindsight i think its a bad sign. it says it is ""aged in toasted oak casks"" but doesn't say for how long. another bad sign. if david beckham put his name on this, well then that guy has never drank scotch before.fabulous whisky. this has become my favourite of all. slight taste of vanilla.excellent taste with a fruity flavor.. enjoyed a good whiskey after a long timevery smooth indeed! characters are spot on.i want to add to my existing review - comparing this beverage to a single malt is like comparing a chevy chase film to 2001: a space odyssey. there is a world of difference between the two; but both can be good in their own rights. what i want to say is that it is not possible to exist on low-end fun or high-end philosophy alone - it turns one into a bore (hope i'm not!). this is why this drink is fine with me - but not all the time. variety is the spice of life, and it is not a single malt. but, instead it is a rather pleasant drink. don't take it too seriously, and enjoy it for what it is. by the way, i am a graphic designer, and knowing how this business works, i deliberately extracted the bottle design, the packaging, the branding and the endorsements from my mind before i drank this whisky from a clear glass with a clear mind.i'm drinking it right now as i type. first time i've tried it. i think the mistake is to compare it to it's illustrious relative, the single malt. i've not drank a single grain whisky before - plenty of single malts. comparing product a to product b seems to be a mistake. we all like what we like as personal favourites - yet without expanding our alcoholic experiences, life would be a jaded experience indeed. diversity in alcohol is indeed a wonderful concept. so, i'm giving haig club (regardless of beckham) a 5, because upon its own merits, it is smooth, makes me tipsy (baileys on steroids comes to mind) - and so what if it's for a younger market? i'm nearly 50, but our children are the future - celebrate them & drink with them! when i want something cerebral and deep, a single malt it will be... but this drink is great - on it's own merits. stop comparing two totally different drinks. its like comparing orange and purple - both can be great in the right context. so, lighten up when you want to be light and drink haig - and go down deep when you need to hit the source, and drink a single malt.really easy to knock next to a more complex whisky but it is super smooth, creamy and sweet which makes as a great first stepping stone. light and fits into the style of fresh tasting japanese whisky.very little other than alcohol on the nose, and the palate disappears in an instant. not even the alcohol that existed on the nose is there on the palate, it turns to little more than water in your mouth. it does have an excellent mouthfeel, but there's simply no reason to keep it on your tongue because there's no taste to it. some sweet notes arrive after you swallow, as does the alcohol, but it's far too little far too late. an utter joke of a whisky for the price they're asking, for a £35-45 whisky to be near-undrinkable without a mixer is unacceptable. you could buy a bottle of bell's for 1/3 of the price!horrible. smells like turps, tastes worse. none of the flavours i look for in a whiskey let alone a single malt scotch. if you can even call it that. glad i got it cheap cause if i paid full price i’d be pissed off.it is what it says it is - easy going, not very complex but smooth and likeable, nicely marketed without being very special - and too expensive david beckham is a very appropriate brand ambassador.very bland and disappointing whisky. would be great at £10-£15, but absolutely baffling at this price",
j&b rare® blended scotch whisky,alcohol,shirley,"Inspired by an Italian, created in London and distilled in Scotland, J&B Rare is unlike any other Scotch whisky. It brings together 42 single malt and grain whiskies and carefully blends them to create a subtle, smooth and complex flavour. It’s this delicate balance that gives J&B Rare its distinctive character – if we took even one whisky away, you would taste the difference. At the heart of J&B Rare are malt whiskies from Speyside, a region recognised as the superior area in Scotland for making single malt whisky. They provide the fruity, fresh quality you can taste, and also give J&B its light colour. Added to that are some of the finest grain whiskies Scotland has to offer. They help reveal the individual flavours of the various malts, unveiling the smooth character of J&B Rare. Great in a cocktail, the unique blend makes it perfect for mixing – so by all means go overboard on the mixers, but please don’t go overboard on the J&B.","poured in a glass and was put off by the lightness on the eyes. on the palate made up for anything i thought would be lacking.not sure why the the rave reviews. a little bit like white spirit: not enough aging and flavour. inoffensive though. 2.5 starsabsolutely stunning for the price. sweet, with a touch of smoke & peat, j&b has been a staple on my bar for years. without doubt it is one of the classic blends along with johnnie walker and ballantines. the only negative is the colour, i imagine the lightness puts some off, but it doesn’t bother me in the slightest! such a shame that this is rarely available in bars in the uk, we seem to prefer to serve lesser blended scotch, but when you travel around the world, this will feature in the selection of any bar worth it’s salt.what a tastemy grandmother has had this in her cabinet since i can remember. the yellow label is just one of those childhood memories (visually of course). until now! 39-years-old and a traveled chef who has tasted, sipped, enjoyed as well as simply guzzled my fair share of pleasant to rot-gut liquors. i finally tasted her j&b with quite the satisfied outcome. then i slowly poured myself two more! my conscience slapped me thinking maybe this is some high dollar hooch! pleasantly surprised to find that it isn't even close to the price of murray mcdavid or even macallan 18. fantastically smooth and rich, without me having to be personally! thumbs up all around.i'm satisfied.have been a j&b man a long time, as dean martin was. puts jw to shame. great taste, great price.i have it is a pleasant drink. it is not exactly rare considering how freely available it is?tried it on a plane and loved it. tasted like expensive, world-class whisky. so surprised to see it so cheap! definitely buying a bottle or two.one of the best scotch i have ever tasted...luv j&ban absolute classic, and much like johnnie walker black and ballantines, j&b is always a welcome friend wherever you find yourself in the world. predominately for the export market it seems, it’s a shame you don’t see it more often in pubs/bars here because in spain it is in every bar you walk into! i’ve always thought the light colour of j&b in the glass as not great on the eye, but don’t let that put you off. what you get is a nice sweet whiskey, with a hint of smoke and a pleasant fruitiness to it.bloody amazing.perfect for the priceundeniably a fantastic blend and a fantastic blend but if you like this you should give teachers a try it's cheaper and has more malty crunch! they're very similar in many ways.absolutely the cheapest scotch i will drink. perfect flavor for a blended. always enjoy on the rocks or with soda... no other way.j&an has been my choice for about 40 years. started with a lemon slice at first to cut taste. now just over rocks. love it. however not readily available in southern states and florida. usually have to drink dewars which is usually available. not really a fan of single malts. would get them as gifts and would give them away.from single malts to blended, for twenty years this stuff is my constant whiskey in the house. either over two cubes or with rochester ginger ale is how i enjoy it.i've been buying scotch lately in contrast to bourbon, got some johnny walker, red, black, double, and even some gold, they seemed ok, but put a hole in the pocket, wanted something affordable and picked up some j&b, boy was i surprised, you can taste the speysides and even a fruitiness i like, with even a wisp of smoke...after drinking johnny black this is a little better then the red to me and almost as good as the black if not equal due to the difference in blend and price!nice sweet whiskylove it, in rotation with jameson & bushmills. hugging 70 years young.",

Aroma Burnt blackened fruit cake with caramel, maple charcoal, roasted macadamia nuts and bourbon. Taste Dilute subdued flavours of buttery toffee popcorn, caramel and pecan pie nuttiness. Very bourbon and coke with a lemon slice made dilute and slightly flat by being left in a glass with ice. Aftertaste Burnt toffee/caramel and maple syrup.",Highly ginger aroma.

Finish: The long warming finish combines spicy oak tannins and lingering smoke.","this must be what the gods drinkdoesn’t quite have the signature black label fire, really it's more smoke than flame, so lacking something. however, for folks who like it smoother and sweeter than the usual it’s a nice dram.superbought for my brother as a christmas present. he liked it and was thrilled with the personalised label. the bottle arrived next day or the day after if i am not mistaken – as usual, the deliveries are always quicker then expected. well done.the idea of a double black is clever and could have been brilliant if they had just stuck to the 12 year old formula with additional caol ila and talisker bottled at 46%. but this offering is all about charred oak using some young and uninteresting basic whiskies. clearly a much cheaper to produce alternative. not good enough diageo!horrible nosing, awful palate - so thin. just a hand full of smoke! avoid.very strong smell and unpleasant lingering taste. i will stick to normal black or red i will never buy this againif this was a car, it'd be a 1984 2.8i ford granada. brutally designed and takes skill, experience and respect to master and enjoy. love it to bits.my first sip tasted like the inside of an ashtray. after that it improved as i got used to the shock of the tar. it's nice and smooth. i like it.great.really smooth. strong smoke smell. my go to scotch.very enjoyable so far from a rookie scotch drinker. however very similar to johnnie walker black.highly charred casks produces wood smoke galore. cloying sweetness is unpleasant and there is little else in the flavour department.bought for the first time. very good. very smooth. enjoyed more than the higher priced single malts. will definitely be buying again.bought as a 50th birthday gift for my brother. delighted with personalised label and delivery very quick. will definitely use the whisky exchange again.i think this is a quite fabulous blended scotch. finished off my first bottle in such a short time that my girlfriend was almost getting a tad concerned. highly underrated. yes, there are likely some young whiskies in here, but the intensity is a very pleasant one, as is the sweetness and smokiness (which is not overdone at all imo). perhaps not as easy to drink as the regular black (and in fact so different from it that the two really don't have much to do with each other), but i could drink this all day (if that wasn't a fairly bad idea, of course). have only tried it neat so far, and but i will try it with a few drops of water (don't see the point in adding ice here). i really can't think of a better blend for the money, and i also prefer this to many single malts that cost more. i did not expect that at all - in fact my expectations were fairly low. two thumbs up. one of my favourites.simply superba very solid blended scotch, warming and smokey with complexity if you're willing to look for it. citrus and apple are there along with honey and raisins. the finish is darker taking me back to bonfires with treacle toffee. overall a wonderfully drinkable whisky and one i'm sure i will purchase againvery smooth and smokey flavour – love it.was my fav blend until i had green label! jwdb is a fantastic whisky though and more flavour than black label. it's a bridge between the more pungent and powerful islay monsters (which i love).",

johnnie walker® platinum blended scotch whisky,alcohol,shirley,"Johnnie Walker Platinum Label 18 Year Old blends big, classic Johnnie Walker flavours with intriguing contemporary notes of citrus and fragrant almonds. Initially sweet with a warm vanilla undercurrent and a suggestion of tangerines, it moves smoothly over the palate into a nutty, malty dryness before a long finish brings elegant suggestions of soft charcoal smokiness and a beautifully fading citrus zest.","Very smooth with well balance sweetness and long finish, I had the gold explorer ,a dalmore king alexander and the platinum and everybody keep drinking this one . Received this as a holiday gift. It is so good we are afraid to drink it. We found ourselves stranded in a hotel room a 3:00 a.m. due to bad weather and felt it was the perfect time to treat ourselves. Savored 1 finger of this precious liquid for bout 45 minutes and must say it is the best scotch we have ever tasted. So smooth and really delicious. We will buy another bottle before this amazing scotch is no longer available. Where the Blue falls flat in flavor, the Platinum keeps pushing forward in a delightful way. The Platinum is not quite as smooth as the Blue - which is so smooth as to be almost boring - but the Platinum has a buttery texture on the taste buds on the sides and back of your tongue that none of the other Walkers have. I was sad when the complex and sweet Gold 18 year went away. Now I do not care. Platinum is the best Walker out there. Tasting notes: I prefer Blue and Platinum neat. Gold with one tiny ice cube.",
johnnie walker® red label® blended scotch whisky,alcohol,shirley,"Johnnie Walker Red Label was launched in its current form by brothers George and Alexander Walker in 1909, though it had existed as Walker's Special Old Highland Red Label for some years previously. Alexander blended a type of whisky which is more suited to mixing with soda than the heavier, more old-fashioned whiskies, and named it after his grandfather, who had started the family business in 1820. Today it is the world's most popular whisky and is sold in more than 200 markets world-wide. PRODUCER'S TASTING NOTES Nose: Hints of fresh apple, pear and the spark of zest from the elegant Speyside malts. Palate: Fruity sweetness, cinnamon and pepper crackling on the centre of your tongue. Finish: A sophisticated, smoky finish - the signature of all Johnnie Walker blends.","good whisky – smoky and a little peaty. good for everyday drinksharsh and unpleasant. for the money, the famous grouse is far superior. so is dewars. probably okay for mixed drinks, but who wants a mixed drink with scotch?this is a bit too smoky for my taste, but if that’s your thing you’ll probably like this.this is a good blended scotch. only malt snobs hate it.sweeter than i expected. smokey and a little peaty. i like it.i tried it in bulgaria golden sands last year. it's taste was great and i will never forget it!this stuff is horrible. it tastes so bad, like smoked, burnt grass. i would not recommend it.jw red label is one of my favourites. as i said in other reviews, i tasted a few entry level blended scoth whisky's side by side, older and new one's, and for me, generally, they are fall down in quality. my style of scotch is that smokey like this one or passport scotch, black&white, black bottle or william lawson's. no doubt that jw black label is a good scotch, once it's my reference when i think in scotch, but it's only a bit deep than red. jw red label is very similar and not so smooth. the smoothness sometimes can be bored, and jw red label is bit more explosive with well integrated smoky and malt. i like very much the smell of this whisky.it's the best whiskyi used to think this was not good. i came back to it and really like it. neat. really like it.i bought a bottle of this. this was horrible. it tasted like something foreign was added. i tried to complain about this on their web site in the ""contact"" page, but the form is buggy and would not let me submit the form with the complaint. i wouldn't recommend this stuff to anyonered label: you can't compare this with the others in the jw stable, would be unfair. would be a good introduction for anyone not too sure about smoke as it come through faintly. that said, for the price it's a fantastic daily driver, which is what i use it for.for the price, this is an excellent scotch. my go-to jw is green label, but i like this now and then. it also mixes well and makes a nice rob roy, if you are into cocktails. i also keep three or four single malts in my bar. as for some of the comments about american whiskey, i can't figure it out. we have some nice whiskeys and bourbons here that stand up well to various whiskeys made around the world. jim beam black, maker's 46, knob creek, weller's and buffalo trace, among others, make some excellent whiskeys and bourbons, as do the canadians. i prefer scotch, but i keep plenty of the other whiskeys around for my guests who have a different preference. i give red a four star rating because we are comparing it to others in its price range, like dewar's white label, which is ok, also. if you compare it to the higher end jw's and single malts, you are doing it a disservice.not a bad scotch but j&b and famous grouse is much, much better as far as your basic scotch goes.seriously do not understand how some people say this is trash.. this is a damn good dram! wow man.. i have to say this is the best cheap whisky i've ever had! personally i wouldn't mix it with anything. it's good the way it is but to each their own make it the way you like. completely love that signature johnnie taste. my mind is blown i was expecting this to be bad because of what other people were saying... it's not. it's a good, solid bargain whisky to have on your bar. period.it's strongit tastes like the put gasoline in a bottle of whiskey and sold it. very disappointed as i am a fan of walker's drinksenjoying now, perhaps better than black label imo, as someone else below said soft...but with a smoky palate with toffee/buttery and citrus. lovelyi find it much better than any other scotch of the similar value. even i prefer than 12 yrs old including black level.excellent taste , smokey finish",

original bitters,alcohol,shirley,"Urban Moonshine’s hand-crafted Digestive Bitters are a well balanced, aromatic, non-laxative update to traditional bitters formulas. These original digestive bitters are certified organic and handcrafted to please everyone. Why take bitters?","This has saved me from going to a gastro specialist. I am so happy to have found this product. I was bloating like I was seven months pregnant after almost everything I ate. I tried elimination diet, and cut out dairy and soy, which helped, but still have problems with grains, vegetables and other foods like berries. It's crazy. So now I just take this with a little water with almost every meal, and it has made eating bearable again! Cut down the problem by 80% and I just feel better when I take it. It helps right away. I highly recommend trying it. Good Luck! I made the mistake of not re-ordering when running out. My belly has calmed down significantly since my refill arrived. This is the most amazing product! If you ever get an upset tummy, take half a dropper and the positive effect is basically immediate. I HIGHLY recommend this as a staple in your house or your purse (that is where you will find my bottle)! My doctor recommended these because I wanted something natural. They have a strong earthy flavor, but I got use to it. I use a dropper full in an 8oz glass of water and drink it 1st thing in the morning. It helps with bloating and nausea. They work better than the DGL chews I ordered. I highly recommend it to anyone with digestive issues. If I am having a gut attack from food I take Swedish bitters and it will take the attack away It has saved me trips to the emergency room many times I have leaky gut It’s a gut disease They say 80% of the worlds population has it but they just don’t know it After two years of bloating and pain from small amounts of food I am pleased with these bitters. I have been using a half dropper twice a day. The taste is not as horrid as other reviews- strong? yes but that's the purpose. I think going back to what worked before pharmaceuticals took over the world is a good thing. This is my second bottle of digestive bitters. I have Crohn’s and have had lots of digestive issues. I love these bitterness in some H2O and a little gin. 😊 it’s a perfect stomach soother before dinner. This is one of the only things that has helped my acid reflux and stomach issues. It works quickly and helps with digestion and bloating. The taste is pretty strong at first but it is not terrible. I got use to it pretty quickly. I was looking for an herbal alternative to taking Prilosec and this has completely solved my indigestion/slow digestion problem. Great product!",

It's crisps and goes down well with not a lot of hops so you are still able to get that ""IPA taste"" without it being to hoppy like others. Great hoppy IPA My go-to beer for the last few years All these years later....& still one of the best IPA’s ever created! Keep it up! We tap keg each year on Thanksgiving after touch football. This IPA was outstanding. It went too fast. Must buy for cool crisp days with good friends and family. So easy to order, walk in and get. Very good IPA, but there are many these days and this is a bit pricey in the 6pk. Need a 12pk to hit that 14 price range This is such a well balanced beer. Great flavor and not too strong. Tastes great in the mouth, My favorite IPA by far. Even my wife likes it. If you can only choose one IPA, this should be your choice. I have been brewing beer for over 20 years and have tasted over 200 IPA's. Much more flavorful than Stone, no offense to the other reviewers, but very few beers deserve 5 stars. This is a decent IPA with a nice balance of hops and malt, decent aroma, and dry finish. It's a 3.5 star, but since half stars are not an option on TWM's website, I am giving it 3 to balance out the other reviewer's 5. A really memorable (i.e. 5 star) beer has an aroma and taste that you remember after you finish drinking it, and you look forward to having it again. Try this head to head with a Dogfish Head 90 or Stone's Ruin Ten and I think you'll get the idea... I love IPAs, but Maximus is a little too heavy for me. This is perfect!",

peach bitters,alcohol,shirley,"The Bitter Truth Peach Bitters are a contemporary interpretation of a classic style of bitters once popular in the first golden age the cocktail. Although peach bitters never reached the popularity of orange bitters, they were one of the wider used bitters. The Bitter Truth Peach Bitters are fresh and fruity with intense peach notes, backed up by a seducing hint of almonds. A combination of fresh peach aroma and subtle spicy flavors adds an exquisite fruitiness to cocktails and long drinks. They work well with clear and aged spirits such as cognac and bourbon whiskey. A Mint Julep will be lifted to new heights. Tasting Notes: Delicate peach notes, balanced with hints of almonds and backed up with spices and balanced bitter nuances. Fruity with a faint almond bitterness from the pits. The natural aroma of fresh peaches dominates while it is completed by fresh citrus and unobtrusive spice flavors. The finish tails off with a herbaceous, nutty note, leaving more fizzy peach to linger.","December 13, 2014 at 11:30 pm...a bar in Helsinki, Finland. I sat on a classy leather sofa, mesmerized as across the room, one of the pre-eminent mixologists in the country, Jaakko, shuffled through the creation of four masterpieces at one time. His hands were like those of a conductor, flowing back and forth, adding liquor, fruit, mixers and more...all seemingly at once. A dropper would fall into a drink and he would taste the creation to confirm that the appropriate mix of melted ice water and booze would come together in exactly the right way. Anyway...I digress. I love an Old Fashioned. I love multiple Old Fashioneds, even as I remain unsure whether putting an S at the end is appropriate grammar. Yet it seems that every time I'm in a bar, my Old Fashioned tastes different. Until Jaakko's Old Fashioned, that is. I had been to this place a number of times before and truly, every drink they made seemed like a masterpiece of sorts. But the Old Fashioned was seriously out of this world and it was always perfect. During this most recent visit after that first sweet sip of genius, I decided I had to go engage Jaakko and learn how he made my favorite drink. So I did. I walked up to the bar, waited until he was finished his current order and introduced myself. I told him that his Old Fashioned was the best I've ever had and I was hoping he would enlighten me as to the how and the why. HIs response? Well...I learned that Jaakko's favorite drink was also an Old Fashioned and immediately, I understood the relevance. He then provided me with TWO key tips: Tip ONE: Jaakko said that all too often, people order their Old Fashioned with Makers Mark bourbon. He felt that using Knob Creek was a much better fit. He said it has a slightly sweeter and spicier taste which goes well with the bitters...that brings me to the 2nd tip. Tip TWO: Two kinds of bitters. Jaakko makes his Old Fashioned with regular old Angostura bitters BUT ALSO with a few dashes of Peach bitters. Boom. That's what I was looking for. I thanked him, told him I would see him again and returned to my sofa seat, opened my Amazon app and immediately purchased these Peach bitters to be waiting for me when I got home five days later. On my first night home, I bought a bottle of Knob Creek and recreated Jaakko's Old Fashioned. I didn't have the perfect ice, of course, and I wasn't in the cold yet dark warmth of a Helsinki bar during winter but it was the best I've ever made and that is good enough. Buy these bitters. Buy these bitters. I really should get back to work. I love Fee Brothers products. I use a lot of them for various recipes and concoctions throughout the year. The peach bitters are used primarily for a peach sangria that I make from scratch each summer when the peaches are in abundance. The bitters add just the right amount of kick that would be sorely lacking had it not been included. Anything by Fee Brothers is worth the investment. I've tried these bitters in two drinks so far and it has been a great addition to both. The peach flavor comes through perfectly -- it's a natural-tasting flavor, not artificial at all. The first thing that strikes you might be the price. It may be the most expensive four ounces of liquid in my house right now, but a little bit goes a long, long way. Bitter has made an intense comeback onto the craft-cocktail scene at bars and restaurants, and amazon is making it super easy to create your own craft cocktail at home by offering almost the entire Fee Brothers line of bitters. Fee Brothers has always been our bitter manufacturer of choice and we were super excited to see amazon offering it at such an amazing price. This flavor, Peach, has been pushed to the front of the line at our bar since we have been playing around with some fun southern cocktails... is there anything more southern than a Georgia Peach? A+ on Value, Shipping and Quality. Good Ice, a little white wine, couple shakes of bitters and soda water - what a yummy drink. The bitters jazzes up an otherwise ordinary drink. And try the Plum Bitters too - they are great! If you make your own iced tea, this (plus a pinch of citric acid) is just the thing to get that slightly tart peach flavoring that Snapple does so well. This, and the ""old fashioned"" bitters, are my favorite flavorings for iced tea. For a change we like to use these Peach Bitters and their Black Walnut Bitters together in our Manhattans. So good!",

The Bitter Truth Pimento Dram is based on selected pimento/allspice (also called Jamaica pepper) and the finest Jamaican rum.

Although Guinness's palate still features a characteristic ""tang"", the company has refused to confirm whether this type of blending still occurs.

premium lager,alcohol,claire,"A beer that straddles between the mainstream Pale Lager and Pilsner. Not all beers that call themselves Premium Lager are, but those that are will typically have a deep gold to light bronze colour, and distinct influence of malt and hops. They should be free of adjuncts and will have a softer carbonation than Pale Lager or Classic German Pilsner. IBUs will typically range in the 20’s, and lagering times will typically be 4-6 weeks, more in line with what pilsners have. Overall accent will be malty-to-balanced, alcohol in a slightly tighter range than either Pale Lager or Pilsner (4.5-5.5%). Most often the product of a microbrewery or brewpub, but macrobreweries can make this style if they jack up the hops a bit and make it all-malt.

sauvignon blanc,alcohol,claire,"Sauvignon blanc is a green-skinned grape variety that originates from the Bordeaux region of France. The grape most likely gets its name from the French words sauvage (""wild"") and blanc (""white"") due to its early origins as an indigenous grape in South West France.[1] It is possibly a descendant of Savagnin. Sauvignon blanc is planted in many of the world's wine regions, producing a crisp, dry, and refreshing white varietal wine. The grape is also a component of the famous dessert wines from Sauternes and Barsac. Sauvignon blanc is widely cultivated in France, Chile, Romania, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the states of Washington and California in the US. Some New World Sauvignon blancs, particularly from California, may also be called ""Fumé Blanc"", a marketing term coined by Robert Mondavi in reference to Pouilly-Fumé.

Depending on the climate, the flavor can range from aggressively grassy to sweetly tropical. In cooler climates, the grape has a tendency to produce wines with noticeable acidity and ""green flavors"" of grass, green bell peppers and nettles with some tropical fruit (such as passion fruit) and floral (such as elderflower) notes. In warmer climates, it can develop more tropical fruit notes but risk losing a lot of aromatics from over-ripeness, leaving only slight grapefruit and tree fruit (such as peach) notes.[2]

Wine experts have used the phrase ""crisp, elegant, and fresh"" as a favorable description of Sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley and New Zealand.[3][4] Sauvignon blanc, when slightly chilled, pairs well with fish or cheese, particularly chèvre. It is also known as one of the few wines that can pair well with sushi.[5]

Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc was one of the first fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in commercial quantities, especially by New Zealand producers. The wine is usually consumed young, as it does not particularly benefit from aging, as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended aging. Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential.[2]

The first Friday in May is International Sauvignon Blanc Day.[citation needed]",,
sherry,alcohol,claire,"Sherry (Spanish: Jerez [xeˈɾeθ]) is a fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the city of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain. Sherry is produced in a variety of styles made primarily from the Palomino grape, ranging from light versions similar to white table wines, such as Manzanilla and Fino, to darker and heavier versions that have been allowed to oxidise as they age in barrel, such as Amontillado and Oloroso. Sweet dessert wines are also made from Pedro Ximenez or Moscatel grapes, and are sometimes blended with Palomino-based Sherries.

The word ""Sherry"" is an anglicisation of Xeres (Jerez). Sherry was previously known as sack, from the Spanish saca, meaning ""extraction"" from the solera. In Europe, ""Sherry"" has protected designation of origin status, and under Spanish law, all wine labelled as ""Sherry"" must legally come from the Sherry Triangle, an area in the province of Cádiz between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María.[1] In 1933 the Jerez Denominación de Origen was the first Spanish denominación to be officially recognised in this way, officially named D.O. Jerez-Xeres-Sherry and sharing the same governing council as D.O. Manzanilla Sanlúcar de Barrameda.[2]

After fermentation is complete, the base wines are fortified with grape spirit in order to increase their final alcohol content.[3] Wines classified as suitable for aging as Fino and Manzanilla are fortified until they reach a total alcohol content of 15.5 per cent by volume. As they age in barrel, they develop a layer of flor—a yeast-like growth that helps protect the wine from excessive oxidation. Those wines that are classified to undergo aging as Oloroso are fortified to reach an alcohol content of at least 17 per cent. They do not develop flor and so oxidise slightly as they age, giving them a darker colour. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, port wine is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.

Wines from different years are aged and blended using a solera system before bottling, so that bottles of sherry will not usually carry a specific vintage year and can contain a small proportion of very old wine. Sherry is regarded by many wine writers[4] as ""underappreciated""[5] and a ""neglected wine treasure"".[6]",,
talisker® 10 year old,alcohol,claire,"Another that should need no introduction. The thing to look for in Talisker, as with all smoky whiskies, is sweetness that give the requisite balance to the drying effect of smoke. Underneath Talisker's smoke, which ain't as all-pervading as Lagavulin, is a sweet pear-like quality. When young there are notes of the land: heather, moor, sweet seaweed, and a finish that has a distinctive cracked black pepper hit. Appearance: Brilliant gold.
 
Nose: Powerful peat-smoke with sea-water saltiness, the liquor of fresh oysters, a citrus sweetness.

sweet vermouth,alcohol,claire,"Vermouth (/vərˈmuːθ/, UK also /ˈvɜːrməθ/)[1][2] is an aromatized, fortified white wine flavored with various botanicals (roots, barks, flowers, seeds, herbs, and spices) and sometimes colored.

The modern versions of the beverage were first produced in the mid to late 18th century in Turin, Italy.[3] While vermouth was traditionally used for medicinal purposes, its true claim to fame is as an aperitif, with fashionable cafés in Turin serving it to guests around the clock.[3] However, in the late 19th century it became popular with bartenders as a key ingredient in many classic cocktails that have survived to date,[4][5] such as the Martini, the Manhattan, the Rob Roy, and the Negroni. In addition to being consumed as an aperitif or cocktail ingredient, vermouth is sometimes used as an alternative white wine in cooking.

Historically, there have been two main types of vermouth: sweet and dry.[6] Responding to demand and competition, vermouth manufacturers have created additional styles, including extra-dry white, sweet white (blanc or bianco), red, amber (ambre or rosso), and rosé.[7][5]

Vermouth is produced by starting with a base of a neutral grape wine or unfermented wine must. Each manufacturer adds additional alcohol and a proprietary mixture of dry ingredients, consisting of aromatic herbs, roots, and barks, to the base wine, base wine plus spirit or spirit only – which may be redistilled before adding to the wine or unfermented wine must. After the wine is aromatized and fortified, the vermouth is sweetened with either cane sugar or caramelized sugar, depending on the style.[8]

Italian and French companies produce most of the vermouth consumed throughout the world, although Spain, the United States and the United Kingdom are also producers.[3]",,
unpeated whiskey,alcohol,claire,"Scotch single malt whisky can be classified into two main flavours: peated (smoky) and unpeated (non-smoky). The smoky aroma in whisky results from the method of drying the malt. If the malt is dried over a peat fire, the components of the peat smoke that have not been completely turned into carbon dioxide and water vapour adhere to the malt. These aromatic compounds are transported through all production steps into the finished whisky.

In contrast, the malt for unpeated whisky is dried with hot air without any smoke. The preferences for one of the two production methods are distributed quite asymmetrically among the consumers. A majority of connoisseurs like both peated and unpeated whiskies. Another fraction prefers peated whisky and tolerates unpeated whisky. However, a non-negligible percentage of connoisseurs do not like peated whisky. Therefore different sets of peated, unpeated and mixed whisky samples were offered to the participants, thus making sure that each participant received the type of whisky they liked best.

This approach made sure that no whiskies were rated poorly due to individual preferences or dislikes. Perhaps this approach is also the reason why the mean value of the quality ratings (3.3 to 3.5 points) was 0.3 to 0.5 scale points (7.5% to 12.5%) above the middle of the scale (3.0). Perhaps the reason for these ratings above the mean value was that the participants liked the samples a bit more than the average of the whiskies they know. But maybe the blind tasting was just so interesting and unusual that the whiskies were rated slightly better than average.",,

A chocolatier is a person who prepares confectionery from chocolate, and is distinct from a chocolate maker, who creates chocolate from cacao beans and other ingredients. Cotton candy is a form of spun sugar often prepared using a cotton candy machine.",,
cranberries,garnish,ian,"Cranberries are a group of evergreen dwarf shrubs or trailing vines in the subgenus Oxycoccus of the genus Vaccinium. In Britain, cranberry may refer to the native species Vaccinium oxycoccos,[1] while in North America, cranberry may refer to Vaccinium macrocarpon.[2] Vaccinium oxycoccos is cultivated in central and northern Europe, while Vaccinium macrocarpon is cultivated throughout the northern United States, Canada and Chile.[3] In some methods of classification, Oxycoccus is regarded as a genus in its own right.[4] They can be found in acidic bogs throughout the cooler regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Cranberries are low, creeping shrubs or vines up to 2 meters (7 ft) long and 5 to 20 centimeters (2 to 8 in) in height;[5] they have slender, wiry stems that are not thickly woody and have small evergreen leaves. The flowers are dark pink, with very distinct reflexed petals, leaving the style and stamens fully exposed and pointing forward. They are pollinated by bees. The fruit is a berry that is larger than the leaves of the plant; it is initially light green, turning red when ripe. It is edible, but with an acidic taste that usually overwhelms its sweetness.",,
crushed biscuit,garnish,ian,"Biscuit is a term used for a variety of primarily flour-based baked food products. The term is applied to two distinct products. This article covers the type of biscuit found in Africa, Asia and Europe, which is typically hard, flat and unleavened. In North America, a biscuit is typically a soft, leavened quick bread, and is covered in the article Biscuit (bread).",,
cucumber slice,garnish,ian,"The cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other supporting frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils.[1] The plant may also root in a soilless medium and will sprawl along the ground if it does not have supports. The vine has large leaves that form a canopy over the fruits. The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical, but elongated with tapered ends, and may be as large as 60 centimeters (24 in) long and 10 centimeters (3.9 in) in diameter.[citation needed] Botanically speaking, the cucumber is classified as a pepo, a type of botanical berry with a hard outer rind and no internal divisions. Much like tomato and squash, it is often perceived, prepared and eaten as a vegetable. Cucumber fruits consist of 95% water (see nutrition table).",,

fresh peach,garnish,ian,"The specific name persica refers to its widespread cultivation in Persia (modern-day Iran), from where it was transplanted to Europe. It belongs to the genus Prunus which includes the cherry, apricot, almond and plum, in the rose family. The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated seed shell. Due to their close relatedness, the inside of a peach stone tastes remarkably similar to almond, and peach stones are often used to make a cheap version of marzipan, known as persipan.[4] Peaches and nectarines are the same species, even though they are regarded commercially as different fruits. In contrast to peaches, whose fruits present the characteristic fuzz on the skin, nectarines are characterized by the absence of fruit-skin trichomes (fuzz-less fruit); it is thought that a mutation in a single gene (MYB25) is responsible for the hair or no-hair difference between the two.[5][6]",,

coffee bean,garnish,ian,"A coffee bean is a seed of the coffee plant and the source for coffee. It is the pit inside the red or purple fruit often referred to as a cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also a so-called stone fruit. Even though the coffee beans are seeds, they are referred to as ""beans"" because of their resemblance to true beans. The fruits – coffee cherries or coffee berries – most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together. A small percentage of cherries contain a single seed, instead of the usual two. This is called a ""peaberry"". The peaberry occurs only between 10 and 15% of the time, and it is a fairly common (yet scientifically unproven) belief that they have more flavour than normal coffee beans.[1] Like Brazil nuts (a seed) and white rice, coffee beans consist mostly of endosperm.[2]",,
food colouring,garnish,ian,"Food coloring, or color additive, is any dye, pigment or substance that imparts color when it is added to food or drink. They come in many forms consisting of liquids, powders, gels, and pastes. Food coloring is used both in commercial food production and in domestic cooking. Food colorants are also used in a variety of non-food applications including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, home craft projects, and medical devices.[2]",,
garnish with pea shoots and mint,garnish,ian,"The pea is most commonly the small spherical seed or the seed-pod of the pod fruit Pisum sativum. Each pod contains several peas, which can be green or yellow. Pea pods are botanically fruit,[2] since they contain seeds and develop from the ovary of a (pea) flower. The name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae such as the pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and the seeds from several species of Lathyrus. P. sativum is an annual plant, with a life cycle of one year. It is a cool-season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter to early summer depending on location. The average pea weighs between 0.1 and 0.36 gram.[3] The immature peas (and in snow peas the tender pod as well) are used as a vegetable, fresh, frozen or canned; varieties of the species typically called field peas are grown to produce dry peas like the split pea shelled from the matured pod. These are the basis of pease porridge and pea soup, staples of medieval cuisine; in Europe, consuming fresh immature green peas was an innovation of Early Modern cuisine.",,

garnish with raspberry dipped in edible glitter/ gold,garnish,sindoori,"Raspberries are grown for the fresh fruit market and for commercial processing into individually quick frozen (IQF) fruit, purée, juice, or as dried fruit used in a variety of grocery products such as raspberry pie. Traditionally, raspberries were a midsummer crop, but with new technology, cultivars, and transportation, they can now be obtained year-round. Raspberries need ample sun and water for optimal development. Raspberries thrive in well-drained soil with a pH between 6 and 7 with ample organic matter to assist in retaining water.[15] While moisture is essential, wet and heavy soils or excess irrigation can bring on Phytophthora root rot, which is one of the most serious pest problems facing the red raspberry. As a cultivated plant in moist, temperate regions, it is easy to grow and has a tendency to spread unless pruned. Escaped raspberries frequently appear as garden weeds, spread by seeds found in bird droppings.

An individual raspberry weighs 3–5 g (0.11–0.18 oz), and is made up of around 100 drupelets,[16] each of which consists of a juicy pulp and a single central seed. A raspberry bush can yield several hundred berries a year. Unlike blackberries and dewberries, a raspberry has a hollow core once it is removed from the receptacle.",,
grape,garnish,sindoori,"A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis.

green apple,garnish,sindoori,"The Granny Smith is a tip-bearing apple cultivar, which originated in Australia in 1868.[1] It is named after Maria Ann Smith, who propagated the cultivar from a chance seedling. The tree is thought to be a hybrid of Malus sylvestris, the European wild apple, with the North American apple Malus pumila as the polleniser.[citation needed]

The fruit is hard, with a light green skin and crisp, juicy flesh. The flavour is tart and acidic, which possibly limits raw consumption. However, it remains firm when baked, making it a very popular cooking apple[2] used in pies, where it can be sweetened. The apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripe.[3]

It is claimed to be the third most popular apple in America by the US Apple Association.[citation needed].

The Granny Smith was one of four apples honored by the United States Postal Service in a 2013 set of four 33¢ stamps commemorating historic strains, joined by Northern Spy, Baldwin, and Golden Delicious.[4]",,

ground almonds,garnish,sindoori,"While the almond is often eaten on its own, raw or toasted, it is also a component of various dishes. Almonds are available in many forms, such as whole, sliced (flaked, slivered), and as flour. Almond pieces around 2–3 mm in size, called ""nibs"", are used for special purposes such as decoration.[42] Almonds yield almond oil and can also be made into almond butter or almond milk. These products can be used in both sweet and savoury dishes.

Along with other nuts, almonds can be sprinkled over breakfasts and desserts, particularly muesli or ice cream-based dishes. Almonds are used in marzipan, nougat, many pastries (including jesuites), cookies (including French macarons, macaroons), and cakes (including financiers), noghl, and other sweets and desserts. They are also used to make almond butter, a spread similar to peanut butter, popular with peanut allergy sufferers and for its naturally sweeter taste. The young, developing fruit of the almond tree can be eaten whole (green almonds) when they are still green and fleshy on the outside and the inner shell has not yet hardened. The fruit is somewhat sour, but is a popular snack in parts of the Middle East, eaten dipped in salt to balance the sour taste. Also in the Middle East they are often eaten with dates. They are available only from mid-April to mid-June in the Northern Hemisphere; pickling or brining extends the fruit's shelf life.

Almond cookies, Chinese almond biscuits, and Italian ricciarelli are made with almonds.

In Greece, ground blanched almonds are used as the base material in a great variety of desserts, usually called amygdalota (αμυγδαλωτά). Because of their white color, most are traditionally considered wedding sweets and are served at wedding banquets. In addition, a soft drink known as soumada is made from almonds in various regions.
In Hejaz, a region of Saudi Arabia, ground almonds are used by adding them with cold milk to a hot coffee cup in addition to cinnamon powder and corn starch to make Almond Coffee Gahwat Al-lōz (قهوة اللوز).
In Iran, green almonds are dipped in sea salt and eaten as snacks on street markets; they are called chaqale bâdam. Also sweet almonds are used to prepare a special food for babies, named harire badam. Almonds are added to some foods, cookies, and desserts, or are used to decorate foods. People in Iran consume roasted nuts for special events, for example, during New Year (Nowruz) parties.
In Italy, bitter almonds are the traditional base for amaretti[43][44] (almond macaroons), a common dessert. Traditionally, a low percentage of bitter almonds (10–20%) is added to the ingredients, which gives the cookies their bitter taste (commercially, apricot kernels are used as a substitute for bitter almonds). Almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in torrone. In Apulia and Sicily, pasta di mandorle (almond paste) is used to make small soft cakes, often decorated with jam, pistachio, or chocolate. In Sicily, almond milk is a popular refreshing beverage in summer.
In Morocco, almonds in the form of sweet almond paste are the main ingredient in pastry fillings, and several other desserts. Fried blanched whole almonds are also used to decorate sweet tajines such as lamb with prunes. A drink made from almonds mixed with milk is served in important ceremonies such as weddings and can also be ordered in some cafes. Southwestern Berber regions of Essaouira and Souss are also known for amlou, a spread made of almond paste, argan oil, and honey. Almond paste is also mixed with toasted flour and among others, honey, olive oil or butter, anise, fennel, sesame seeds, and cinnamon to make sellou (also called zamita in Meknes or slilou in Marrakech), a sweet snack known for its long shelf life and high nutritive value.
In Indian cuisine, almonds are the base ingredients of pasanda-style and Mughlai curries. Badam halva is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as sohan barfi), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface. Almonds form the base of various drinks which are supposed to have cooling properties. Almond sherbet or sherbet-e-badaam, is a popular summer drink. Almonds are also sold as a snack with added salt.
In Israel almonds are topping tahini cookie or eaten as a snack.
The 'Marcona' almond cultivar is recognizably different from other almonds and is marketed by name.[45] The kernel is short, round, relatively sweet, and delicate in texture. Its origin is unknown and has been grown in Spain for a long time; the tree is very productive, and the shell of the nut is very hard.[45] 'Marcona' almonds are traditionally served after being lightly fried in oil, and are used by Spanish confectioners to prepare a sweet called turrón.

lavender,garnish,sindoori,"For most cooking applications the dried buds, which are also referred to as flowers, are used. Lavender greens have a more subtle flavour when compared to rosemary.[26]

The potency of the lavender flowers increases with drying which necessitates more sparing use to avoid a heavy, soapy aftertaste. Chefs note to reduce by two-thirds the dry amount in recipes which call for fresh lavender buds.[27][22]

Lavender buds can amplify both sweet and savory flavors in dishes, and are sometimes paired with sheep's-milk and goat's-milk cheeses. Lavender flowers are occasionally blended with black, green, or herbal teas. Lavender flavours baked goods and desserts, pairing especially well with chocolate. In the United States, both lavender syrup and dried lavender buds are used to make lavender scones and marshmallows.[28][29]

Lavender buds are put into sugar for two weeks to allow the essential oils and fragrance to transfer; then the sugar itself is used in baking. Lavender can be used in breads where recipes call for rosemary. Lavender can be used decoratively in dishes or spirits, or as a decorative and aromatic in a glass of champagne. Lavender is used in savory dishes, giving stews and reduced sauces aromatic flair. It is also used to scent flans, custards, and sorbets",,

pomegranate seeds,garnish,sindoori,"Although the pulp of the pomegranate is edible, it is the seeds that provide the real treat. Each seed is individually encased in crimson colored sac.

If not eaten carefully, this same juice can stain the fingers a reddish-purplish color—a telltale sign that the allure of the pomegranate has once again proven too strong. Overall, the seeds and their encasings count for about half of the pomegranate’s weight.

Depending on the variety and degree of ripeness, the seeds of the pomegranate can vary in taste from only a little sour (similar to ripe cherries) to fairly sharp (similar to uncooked cranberries). They can be enjoyed straight by simply eating the seeds, in any of a number of pomegranate-derived goods, or as a juice.

Those with milder tastes often find the commercially-available juice blends more palatable than straight pomegranate juice, which can be fairly robust.

Regardless, the number of orchid species nearly equals the number of bony fishes and is more than twice the number of bird species, and about four times the number of mammal species.

The family encompasses about 6–11% of all seed plants.[4] The largest genera are Bulbophyllum (2,000 species), Epidendrum (1,500 species), Dendrobium (1,400 species) and Pleurothallis (1,000 species). It also includes Vanilla–the genus of the vanilla plant, the type genus Orchis, and many commonly cultivated plants such as Phalaenopsis and Cattleya.

mint to garnish,garnish,claire,"Mentha (also known as mint, from Greek míntha,[2] Linear B mi-ta)[3] is a genus of plants in the family Lamiaceae (mint family).[4] It is estimated that 13 to 18 species exist, and the exact distinction between species is still unclear.[5] Hybridization between some of the species occurs naturally. Many other hybrids, as well as numerous cultivars, are known.

The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution across Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and North America.[6]

Mints are aromatic, almost exclusively perennial herbs. They have wide-spreading underground and overground stolons[7] and erect, square,[8] branched stems. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, from oblong to lanceolate, often downy, and with a serrated margin. Leaf colors range from dark green and gray-green to purple, blue, and sometimes pale yellow.[6] The flowers are white to purple and produced in false whorls called verticillasters. The corolla is two-lipped with four subequal lobes, the upper lobe usually the largest. The fruit is a nutlet, containing one to four seeds.

While the species that makes up the genus Mentha is widely distributed and can be found in many environments, most grow best in wet environments and moist soils. Mints will grow 10–120 cm tall and can spread over an indeterminate area. Due to their tendency to spread unchecked, some mints are considered invasive.[9]",,
peach,garnish,claire,"The peach (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree native to the region of Northwest China between the Tarim Basin and the north slopes of the Kunlun Mountains, where it was first domesticated and cultivated.[3] It bears an edible juicy fruit called a peach or a nectarine.

The specific name persica refers to its widespread cultivation in Persia (modern-day Iran), from where it was transplanted to Europe. It belongs to the genus Prunus which includes the cherry, apricot, almond and plum, in the rose family. The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated seed shell. Due to their close relatedness, the inside of a peach stone tastes remarkably similar to almond, and peach stones are often used to make a cheap version of marzipan, known as persipan.[4]

Peaches and nectarines are the same species, even though they are regarded commercially as different fruits. In contrast to peaches, whose fruits present the characteristic fuzz on the skin, nectarines are characterized by the absence of fruit-skin trichomes (fuzz-less fruit); it is thought that a mutation in a single gene (MYB25) is responsible for the hair or no-hair difference between the two.[5][6]
